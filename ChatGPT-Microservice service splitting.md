## Prompt:
we build a application to provide open API which follow the Financial Data Exchange standard. the application build on microservice architecture (technical stack is spring boot , K8S ) and the first deployment will be on AWS EKS. the team have argument how to split service.  one approach is split according to URL : for exapmle: /us/openbanking/fdx/1.0/aisp/accounts -> service 1, /us/openbanking/fdx/1.0/aisp/accounts/{accountID} -> service 2.  and the second approach is : split by business scenario :  account info, transactions.   Now you are SME of microservice and openbanking. please provide your suggestion according to the best practice of industry

Great question—and a common fork in the road for teams standing up an FDX‑compliant API on Kubernetes.

TL;DR (recommendation)
----------------------

Favor **business‑capability (bounded‑context) services** (e.g., _Accounts_, _Transactions_, _Statements_, _Consent_) over splitting by **URL/endpoint**. Endpoint‑per‑service decomposition quickly devolves into “nanoservices” (an anti‑pattern) that amplifies coupling, cross‑service chatter, and operational overhead. Align service boundaries with domain ownership, data, and teams, then route multiple endpoints to the same service through your API gateway/ingress. This is consistent with industry guidance on microservice boundaries and domain‑driven design.

Why not split by URL?
---------------------

*   **Nanoservice anti‑pattern**: one endpoint per service means hundreds of tiny deployables, version coordination hell, and more hops for a single user flow. You pay a performance and reliability tax for little gain. [BMC](https://www.bmc.com/blogs/microservice-vs-nanoservice/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
*   **Poor domain ownership**: URL pieces (e.g., `/accounts` vs `/accounts/{id}`) are not business boundaries; you’ll need the same data model, caching and auth checks in both. Splitting them forces data duplication or extra calls.
*   **Harder versioning**: Coordinated releases across many tiny services make FDX version upgrades (e.g., moving from v6.0 to v6.4) riskier. Keep a smaller number of well‑scoped services and shift routing at the edge. [Financial Data Exchange](https://financialdataexchange.org/)
*   **Observability and SLOs**: Tracing and SLOs are simpler when a capability is owned by a single service that can be measured and scaled independently. Guidance from cloud reference architectures lands on business‑capability boundaries for this reason. [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/microservices/model/domain-analysis?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* * *

FDX specifics you should anchor on
----------------------------------

*   **Use FDX’s resource model and pathing**. FDX implementations commonly expose endpoints under `/fdx/v{major}/…` such as `/fdx/v4|v6/accounts`, `/fdx/v6/accounts/{accountId}/transactions`, `/fdx/v6/customers/current`, `/fdx/v6/capability`. Do **not** mix UK‑OB/PSD2 path conventions like `/aisp` with FDX; route everything under an FDX base path and region prefix only if you truly need it. [MX Docs+1](https://docs.mx.com/products/data/data-access/data-recipient-reference/fdx/)
*   **Track the latest FDX**. FDX’s current public release stream is v6.x (Spring 2025 shows **FDX API v6.4**). Design so you can run v6.x alongside older versions during migrations. [Financial Data Exchange](https://financialdataexchange.org/)
*   **Security**: FDX aligns with OpenID Foundation’s **FAPI** profiles. As of 2025, **FAPI 2.0 Security Profile is final**; adopt its sender‑constrained tokens, PAR/JAR, MTLS or DPoP, and the OAuth Security BCP guidance. [OpenID Foundation](https://openid.net/specs/fapi-security-profile-2_0-final.html)
*   **Eventing & consent lifecycle**: Since FDX 5.1, the spec family includes **Event Notifications**, **Consent revocation**, and **asynchronous statements**—all of which argue for dedicated services and async patterns, not URL‑based slices. [Financial Data Exchange](https://www.financialdataexchange.org/FDX/FDX/News/Press-Releases/Financial%20Data%20Exchange%20Releases%20FDX%20API%205.1.aspx)

Suggested service decomposition (AWS EKS, Spring Boot)
------------------------------------------------------

### Edge & security

1.  **API Gateway / Ingress**
    *   ALB Ingress Controller + AWS WAF (or an API Gateway at the edge) terminating TLS, request validation, rate‑limits, and routing by path to backend services.
    *   Route **multiple endpoints to the same capability service** (see mapping below).
2.  **Authorization Server (AS) / Token Service**
    *   Dedicated component (buy or build) implementing **FAPI 2.0**: PAR, JAR, MTLS or DPoP, JWKS rotation, token introspection where needed. Keep it separate from resource servers. (Evaluate products vs. Spring Authorization Server maturity for FAPI 2.0.) [OpenID Foundation](https://openid.net/specs/fapi-security-profile-2_0-final.html)
3.  **Consent Management Service**
    *   Owns creation, storage, retrieval and **revocation** of consents; maps FDX permissions/scopes to resources; publishes consent‑changed events for data minimization across participants. [Financial Data Exchange](https://www.financialdataexchange.org/FDX/FDX/News/Press-Releases/Financial%20Data%20Exchange%20Releases%20FDX%20API%205.1.aspx)

### Core domain services (FDX resource servers)

4.  **Accounts Service**
    *   Owns account catalog (all account types FDX models), balances snapshotting, and `/fdx/v6/accounts*`.
5.  **Transactions Service**
    *   High‑volume reads; pagination, filtering (`startTime`, `endTime`, `offset`, `limit`). Optionally maintain a read‑optimized store and stream updates from the core system. Serves `/fdx/v6/accounts/{accountId}/transactions`. [MX Docs](https://docs.mx.com/products/data/data-access/data-recipient-reference/fdx/)
6.  **Statements Service**
    *   Handles large files and **async retrieval** patterns for statements; produces pre‑signed URLs if you offload blobs to S3. [Financial Data Exchange](https://www.financialdataexchange.org/FDX/FDX/News/Press-Releases/Financial%20Data%20Exchange%20Releases%20FDX%20API%205.1.aspx)
7.  **Customer (Party) Service**
    *   PII endpoints like `/fdx/v6/customers/current`; encapsulates privacy controls and redaction rules. [MX Docs](https://docs.mx.com/products/data/data-access/data-recipient-reference/fdx/)
8.  **Capability/Metadata Service**
    *   `/fdx/v6/capability` and other metadata; often static but isolating it keeps compatibility surface small. [MX Docs](https://docs.mx.com/products/data/data-access/data-recipient-reference/fdx/)

### Integration & cross‑cutting

9.  **Data‑Provider Adapter(s)**
    *   Anti‑corruption layer(s) that translate from your core/issuer/aggregator systems into the canonical FDX models; isolate vendor churn here.
10.  **Event & Notification Service**
    *   Internal bus (Kafka/MSK or SNS/SQS) plus external webhooks to support **FDX Event Notifications**; notify on consent changes, data availability, outages, etc. [Financial Data Exchange](https://www.financialdataexchange.org/FDX/FDX/News/Press-Releases/Financial%20Data%20Exchange%20Releases%20FDX%20API%205.1.aspx)
    11.  **Audit & Observability**
    *   Centralized audit trail (WORM), OpenTelemetry tracing, metrics and logs. Include a correlation ID header; many ecosystems use `x-fapi-interaction-id` for cross‑party tracing (optional but useful). [openid.bitbucket.io](https://openid.bitbucket.io/fapi/fapi-2_0-implementation_advice.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

> **Data per service**: give each capability its **own datastore** (RDS/Aurora, DynamoDB, etc.), enforce access through service APIs, and accept eventual consistency where it simplifies scaling. This is standard microservice practice. [martinfowler.com](https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* * *

Example: route endpoints to capabilities (not to “one URL = one service”)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

```
/fdx/v6/accounts                      -> Accounts Service
/fdx/v6/accounts/{accountId}          -> Accounts Service
/fdx/v6/accounts/{id}/transactions    -> Transactions Service
/fdx/v6/accounts/{id}/statements      -> Statements Service
/fdx/v6/customers/current             -> Customer Service
/fdx/v6/capability                    -> Capability Service
```

Your ingress/gateway owns the path rules; services don’t need to share the same prefix to coexist. This keeps cohesion (data + logic together) while preserving a **single, spec‑compliant surface**.

* * *

Versioning & evolution
----------------------

*   Put **major version in the path** (`/fdx/v6/...`). Support N and N–1 concurrently at the edge, with **endpoint‑to‑service routing rules**. This makes FDX updates (e.g., v6.0 → v6.4) a routing change plus localized service updates. [Financial Data Exchange](https://financialdataexchange.org/)
*   Use **Consumer‑Driven Contract tests** (e.g., Pact) on your FDX JSON schemas; gate releases in CI.
*   Offer **/capability** to advertise optional features and de‑risk minor changes. [MX Docs](https://docs.mx.com/products/data/data-access/data-recipient-reference/fdx/)

* * *

Security & privacy notes for FDX on EKS
---------------------------------------

*   **FAPI 2.0** profile at the edge and between AS/client/RS: PAR, JAR, MTLS or DPoP, OAuth Security BCP. Don’t roll your own crypto; lean on proven libs and providers. [OpenID Foundation](https://openid.net/specs/fapi-security-profile-2_0-final.html)
*   **Least data**: enforce consent‑derived scopes in every resource service (transactions, statements…); revoke tokens promptly when consent is withdrawn (per FDX 5.1 consent revocation). [Financial Data Exchange](https://www.financialdataexchange.org/FDX/FDX/News/Press-Releases/Financial%20Data%20Exchange%20Releases%20FDX%20API%205.1.aspx)
*   **East–west mTLS** via a service mesh (App Mesh/Istio) and short‑lived workload identities (IRSA).
*   **PII controls**: field‑level encryption, tokenization where feasible, and strict retention policies in the Customer service.
*   **Tracing**: propagate a correlation ID; if your ecosystem adopts FAPI headers, support `x-fapi-interaction-id`. [openid.bitbucket.io](https://openid.bitbucket.io/fapi/fapi-2_0-implementation_advice.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* * *

EKS platform guardrails (brief)
-------------------------------

*   **Networking**: Private subnets, security groups per tier, NetworkPolicy default‑deny.
*   **Scaling**: HPA/Karpenter; Transactions and Statements typically require separate autoscaling policies.
*   **Storage**: Separate DBs per service; S3 for statements; SSE‑KMS for at‑rest encryption.
*   **Ops**: OpenTelemetry → AMP/AMG or Grafana/Prometheus; cluster‑wide request logs with correlation IDs.
*   **Edge**: ALB Ingress + WAF with IP reputation & bot control; per‑route rate limiting.

* * *

What this looks like for your two proposals
-------------------------------------------

### 1) Split by URL (your example)

*   `/us/openbanking/fdx/1.0/aisp/accounts` → Service A
*   `/us/openbanking/fdx/1.0/aisp/accounts/{id}` → Service B  
    **Issues**: duplicated models, transactional coupling, more hops, painful version upgrades, and non‑FDX path style (the `/aisp` label is a UK‑OB concept, not FDX). [MX Docs](https://docs.mx.com/products/data/data-access/data-recipient-reference/fdx/)

### 2) Split by business scenario (recommended)

*   **Accounts** service: list + detail, balances.
*   **Transactions** service: all query/time‑range logic.
*   **Statements** service: async generation/download.
*   **Customer** service: PII endpoints.
*   **Consent** service: lifecycle + revocation + events.  
    **Benefits**: clear ownership, aligned data, fewer hops, simpler scaling and SLOs, smoother adoption of evolving **FDX v6.x** without destabilizing the whole surface. [Microsoft Learn+1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/microservices/model/microservice-boundaries?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* * *

A quick implementation checklist
--------------------------------

1.  **Contract‑first**: import the FDX OpenAPI (v6.x) and generate stubs for each capability service. (If you don’t have direct spec access, use vendor FDX‑aligned refs as scaffolding.) [MX Docs+1](https://docs.mx.com/products/data/data-access/data-recipient-reference/fdx/)
2.  **Ingress routing**: define path rules that map the FDX surface to capability services as shown above.
3.  **AS & FAPI**: stand up a conformant Authorization Server (PAR/JAR, MTLS or DPoP); wire token validation to resource services. [OpenID Foundation](https://openid.net/specs/fapi-security-profile-2_0-final.html)
4.  **Consent enforcement**: centralize consent storage; expose PDP‑style checks to resource services; publish revocation events. [Financial Data Exchange](https://www.financialdataexchange.org/FDX/FDX/News/Press-Releases/Financial%20Data%20Exchange%20Releases%20FDX%20API%205.1.aspx)
5.  **Data stores**: one per service; seed with provider adapters; add caches/read models for high‑volume queries.
6.  **Observability & headers**: instrument with OpenTelemetry; propagate a correlation ID (`x-fapi-interaction-id` if your ecosystem prefers it). [openid.bitbucket.io](https://openid.bitbucket.io/fapi/fapi-2_0-implementation_advice.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
7.  **Hardening**: WAF, rate limits, DDoS protection, secret management (KMS, Secrets Manager), and least‑privilege IAM (IRSA).

* * *

If helpful, I can sketch a concrete ingress routing example for ALB/Nginx and a Spring Boot project structure that cleanly separates these capabilities.
