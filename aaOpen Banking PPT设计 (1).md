## Open Banking Team 2022–2025 Timeline Slide Design Guide

This guide outlines how to build a single PowerPoint slide with a timeline infographic for a CIO briefing. The slide will highlight the Open Banking team’s evolution from 2022 to 2025, focusing on business impact and efficiency gains rather than technical details.

## Step 1: Craft the Title and Vision Statement

-   **Title:** Place a clear, concise title at the top of the slide. For example, _“Open Banking Team Evolution 2022–2025”_ (or _“2022–2025 Open Banking Timeline: Fast-Track Innovation”_). This immediately tells the CIO what the slide covers.
    
-   **Vision Subtitle:** Under the title, include a brief vision statement or subtitle that encapsulates the team’s overarching goal. For instance: _“Rebuilding the Open Banking platform for simplicity, speed, and scale.”_ Keep it high-level and **business-focused**, avoiding technical jargon[prezentium.com](https://prezentium.com/executive-presentations/#:~:text=Giving%20a%20successful%20presentation%20to,suite%20presentation)[prezentium.com](https://prezentium.com/executive-presentations/#:~:text=,revenue%20growth%2C%20or%20improved%20performance).
    
-   **Vision Bullet Points:** If space allows, list 3–4 key vision pillars in a small, unobtrusive list (use a slightly smaller font than the title). For example:
    
    -   _Simplified, cloud-agnostic architecture_ (simpler system design, not tied to a single cloud provider)
        
    -   _Faster time-to-market_ (rapid delivery of features and products)
        
    -   _Lower cost & higher efficiency_ (optimized resources and cost savings)
        
    -   _Third-party friendly onboarding_ (easy integration for partners)  
        These points distill the team’s vision (simplified architecture, speed, cost-efficiency, partner-friendliness) into executive-friendly language. The goal is to clearly tie the team’s work to **business value** – e.g. agility, cost savings, and growth[prezentium.com](https://prezentium.com/executive-presentations/#:~:text=,revenue%20growth%2C%20or%20improved%20performance). Keep the text minimal and impactful.
        

## Step 2: Draw a Horizontal Timeline Base (2022–2025)

Construct the timeline that will serve as the backbone for your story:

-   **Timeline Shape:** Insert a horizontal arrow or line running left to right across the slide (to indicate progression over time). A single-direction arrow helps guide the viewer’s eye in a clear flow from 2022 to 2025[visme.co](https://visme.co/blog/types-of-infographics/#:~:text=that%20fits%20your%20story). Make the arrow thick enough to be visible but not so heavy that it distracts from the content.
    
-   **Year Markers:** Mark four equidistant points on the line for the years **2022**, **2023**, **2024**, and **2025** (with 2022 at the far left and 2025 at the far right). You can use small shapes (e.g. circles, squares, or pins) or SmartArt timeline graphics to indicate each year. Ensure these markers are evenly spaced and aligned.
    
-   **Labels:** Label each point with the year (e.g., “2022”) in a bold or distinct font. Position the year labels near the markers (above or below the line) so they are clearly associated with their points in time. Using a **distinct color for each year’s segment or marker** can improve clarity – essentially creating color-coded timeline segments that delineate each phase[slidemodel.com](https://slidemodel.com/free-powerpoint-templates/free-square-milestones-timeline-template/#:~:text=Free%20Square%20Milestones%20Timeline%20Template,slides%20for%20more%20focused%20discussion). For example, use a different accent color for each year’s text or marker (e.g., 2022 in blue, 2023 in green, etc.), but keep the palette professional and consistent with your company’s theme. This sets up the timeline structure that the rest of the content will attach to.
    

## Step 3: Outline the Timeline Milestones (2022–2025)

Under each year on the timeline, add a brief description of the key milestone and its impact. Use **infographic-style callouts** (small text boxes or shapes) connected to each year marker. Each milestone description should be concise (one line or two) and **highlight outcomes, not technical details**[prezentium.com](https://prezentium.com/executive-presentations/#:~:text=Giving%20a%20successful%20presentation%20to,suite%20presentation). For readability, you can format these as a horizontal sequence of callout labels or use an alternating layout (some text above the line, some below) if space is tight. Here’s how to phrase each year’s milestone:

-   **2022 – Initiative Kickoff:** _“Team-initiated Open Banking reboot: Containerization POC completed; Rapid Development Toolkit proposed.”_  
    _Visual & Impact:_ Emphasize that this project was **proactively initiated** by the team (“主动发起”) to modernize the platform. This sets the stage for innovation. Keep the text short; for example, on the slide it might read: **“2022 – OB Platform Reboot Initiated (Containerization POC, Dev Toolkit Proposal)”**. You might add a small note or icon to show it’s the foundation year. (At this stage, there may not be a concrete metric, but the callout establishes the proactive start and new approach.)
    
-   **2023 – Smart Sandbox Launch:** _“Delivered a simplified ‘Smart Sandbox’ (Smart Mock Service) – widely adopted across teams.”_  
    _Visual & Impact:_ Highlight the success and adoption. The slide label could be: **“2023 – Smart Sandbox Deployed (Lightweight Mock API Service)”** with a sub-note like _“Adopted by multiple teams for testing”_. To quantify, if you have a number of teams or usage statistic, include it (e.g., “adopted by 8 teams” or “used in 5 departments”). A short **impact callout** could be placed here, such as **“Broad adoption”** or **“Improved testing efficiency”**. The focus is to show that in 2023 the team delivered a useful tool that gained traction (business impact: better testing speed and developer efficiency). Keep the phrasing non-technical – e.g. emphasize _wide adoption_ rather than how the sandbox works.
    
-   **2024 – Rapid PAPI Delivery:** _“OB team built a PAPI prototype in 1 month (previously took 5 months) – 5× faster delivery.”_  
    _Visual & Impact:_ This is a critical efficiency milestone. On the slide: **“2024 – OB-owned PAPI Prototype (1 month delivery vs 5 months)”** could be the label. Right next to it or beneath, include a standout metric callout like **“5× faster delivery!”** in bold or with an icon (such as a speedometer or lightning bolt) to draw attention. This succinctly shows a **quantifiable improvement** – the Open Banking team outpaced the traditional timeline by a factor of five. Executives appreciate such metrics that tie to time savings and efficiency gains (these numbers convey ROI and speed, which is _“what executives want to hear”_[prezentium.com](https://prezentium.com/executive-presentations/#:~:text=Tie%20your%20request%20to%20specific,ROI%29%20will%20be)). By framing it as “5× faster,” you communicate a dramatic improvement in time-to-market.
    
-   **2025 – First Fully Containerized Platform (US PIAID Project):** _“Leading the US PIAID project – deploying the first fully containerized OB platform with in-house application design. Ongoing architecture simplification; DPS POC in progress.”_  
    _Visual & Impact:_ For the current year, stress leadership and innovation. A possible slide label: **“2025 – Full OB Platform Rollout (Cloud-Agnostic & Containerized)”** or **“2025 – US PIAID Launch (100% Containerized Platform)”**. This shows that the team’s vision is being realized this year. Supporting text might note: _“OB team leads first fully containerized Open Banking platform (in-house design). Continued simplification, DPS POC underway.”_ To emphasize business value, include a callout like **“50% faster onboarding”** or **“Streamlined partner integration”** if the new platform significantly improves onboarding speed or efficiency (for example, _“50% reduction in partner onboarding time”_ to highlight improved third-party friendliness). Choose a metric that resonates — e.g., time saved, cost saved, or quality improved. Even if exact figures are not given in the prompt, an estimate or qualitative metric (“faster onboarding”, “lower cost”) will underline the impact. The key is that by 2025, the Open Banking team is **leading a major initiative** and achieving the vision (containerization, efficiency, ease of onboarding), which drives tangible improvements.
    

Each milestone should be brief and **action/result-oriented**. Use strong verbs and highlight outcomes (e.g., “delivered,” “achieved,” “reduced time by X”) instead of technical explanations. The milestones collectively tell a story of increasing impact and efficiency year over year.

## Step 4: Add Icons and Visual Anchors for Each Milestone

Make the slide visually engaging by associating each year’s milestone with an icon or graphic, and by using color coding to differentiate sections:

-   **Icons for Clarity:** Assign a relevant icon to each milestone to serve as a visual anchor[visme.co](https://visme.co/blog/types-of-infographics/#:~:text=Pro%20Tip%3A%20Use%20visuals%20to,the%20timeline%20easy%20to%20follow). For example:
    
    -   _2022:_ Use a _lightbulb icon_ (to represent an idea/initiation) or a _rocket icon_ (to signify the project launch). This highlights the proactive start.
        
    -   _2023:_ Use an _API or puzzle piece icon_ (for the sandbox/mock service) or a _network icon_ representing multiple users/teams (to emphasize wide adoption).
        
    -   _2024:_ Use a _stopwatch_ or _lightning bolt icon_ (to symbolize speed) or a _rocket_ (if not used in 2022) to underscore the “5× faster” achievement.
        
    -   _2025:_ Use a _cloud/container icon_ (for cloud-agnostic, containerized platform) or a _trophy/star_ (to show first-of-its-kind accomplishment and leadership).  
        Place each icon next to its year label or within the year’s callout bubble. The icons should be simple and universally understood, reinforcing the message at a glance[visme.co](https://visme.co/blog/types-of-infographics/#:~:text=Pro%20Tip%3A%20Use%20visuals%20to,the%20timeline%20easy%20to%20follow). They act as visual shorthand (e.g., speed, innovation, cloud) that helps the CIO quickly grasp the theme of each milestone.
        
-   **Color-Coding:** Give each year’s milestone box or icon a distinct color highlight, while keeping the overall scheme coordinated. For instance, you might have a colored shape behind the text or color the icon itself: blue for 2022, green for 2023, orange for 2024, purple for 2025 (choose colors that are consistent with your company’s branding or that contrast enough to distinguish the years). Each stage having a **distinct colored marker** and icon will clearly show the sequence and separation of phases[visme.co](https://visme.co/blog/types-of-infographics/#:~:text=Each%20stage%20of%20the%20process,moving%20nature%20of%20the%20workflow). Color-coded segments or backgrounds can delineate the timeline sections, helping the viewer see the transition from one year to the next at a glance[slidemodel.com](https://slidemodel.com/free-powerpoint-templates/free-square-milestones-timeline-template/#:~:text=Free%20Square%20Milestones%20Timeline%20Template,slides%20for%20more%20focused%20discussion).
    
-   **Connecting Arrows/Lines:** If not already using a continuous arrow, ensure there’s a visual connection between milestones. You can use a subtle right-pointing arrow along the timeline or small arrow shapes between year markers to emphasize progression. This continuous flow underscores the evolution and momentum of the project (e.g., an arrow from 2022 pointing toward 2025). The goal is to _“guide the eye with a clear flow”_ from start to finish[visme.co](https://visme.co/blog/types-of-infographics/#:~:text=Pro%20Tip%3A%20Use%20visuals%20to,the%20timeline%20easy%20to%20follow).
    
-   **Layout Tip:** You may use a horizontal **infographic timeline** SmartArt or manually position shapes. If using SmartArt, choose a timeline or process diagram that allows icons and callouts. If doing manually, ensure alignment is clean: icons uniformly placed (e.g., all above the line or alternating), text boxes aligned, and spacing balanced. Visual consistency is key for an executive audience. By using icons and color strategically, the slide becomes an easy-to-scan infographic: each year’s story is instantly recognizable by its icon and color, even before reading the text.
    

## Step 5: Highlight Business Impact and Refine for Executive Appeal

Now, polish the slide so that it resonates with a CIO and conveys the message **quickly and clearly**:

-   **Emphasize Key Metrics:** Ensure the measurable impacts (speed, adoption, efficiency gains) are **highlighted** either with bold formatting, larger font, or callout shapes. For example, the “5× faster delivery” text could be in a bold, contrasting color or inside a shape (like a starburst or arrow shape near the 2024 milestone). Similarly, “50% onboarding time reduction” for 2025 could be in italics or a different color. These metrics should stand out visually from the descriptive text. Quantitative callouts act as proof points of success and will draw the CIO’s eye immediately. Such data-driven headlines are effective because executives “want answers, not details,” and they appreciate seeing evidence of ROI or improvements at a glance[prezentium.com](https://prezentium.com/executive-presentations/#:~:text=Tie%20your%20request%20to%20specific,ROI%29%20will%20be).
    
-   **Clarity and Brevity:** Review the text on the slide and trim any unnecessary words. The slide should have **short phrases or bullet-like callouts**, not long sentences. Aim for each milestone description to be a punchy phrase, ~5-7 words if possible, with perhaps a brief sub-point. For instance, instead of a full sentence like “The Open Banking team delivered a proof of concept for PAPI in one month whereas it took the PAPI team five months,” the slide just says **“PAPI Prototype in 1 Month (vs 5 months)”**. This keeps it concise. Use simple language and avoid technical acronyms (other than well-known ones) or elaborate details – remember that _senior leaders are busy and focus on outcomes, not the finer details_[prezentium.com](https://prezentium.com/executive-presentations/#:~:text=Giving%20a%20successful%20presentation%20to,suite%20presentation). Every word on the slide should serve a purpose.
    
-   **Readable Formatting:** Use a legible font size (nothing too small – likely no less than ~18-20pt for body text on a slide). Ensure there is good contrast between text and background (e.g., dark text on a light background or vice versa). Keep plenty of **white space** around elements; do not clutter the slide with dense text. An infographic-style slide benefits from whitespace and clear separation of sections[visme.co](https://visme.co/blog/types-of-infographics/#:~:text=Pro%20Tip%3A%20Keep%20your%20infographic,use%20to%20avoid%20visual%20overload). If some text looks cramped, abbreviate it or split it into a short title plus sub-text. The slide should look clean and _“scannable with short sentences, whitespace, bullet points and bold highlights”_[visme.co](https://visme.co/blog/types-of-infographics/#:~:text=Pro%20Tip%3A%20Keep%20your%20infographic,use%20to%20avoid%20visual%20overload) so the CIO can digest the key points in seconds.
    
-   **Executive Tone:** Frame each point in terms of **business value or improvement**. For example, highlight time saved, adoption, speed, cost efficiency, risk reduction, etc., rather than technical milestones. This aligns the content with what the CIO cares about (outcomes, efficiency, strategy)[prezentium.com](https://prezentium.com/executive-presentations/#:~:text=,revenue%20growth%2C%20or%20improved%20performance). Make sure the vision statement and each milestone clearly connect to those themes. You’ve already included metrics like 5× faster and 50% reduction – these directly translate to efficiency and speed, which is great. Also ensure the vision keywords (simplified, fast, low-cost, efficient, friendly) are either visible on the slide (in the vision section or implied by the milestones) and reinforce these outcomes.
    
-   **Visual Consistency:** Give the slide a once-over for consistency in design. Icons should be the same style (e.g., all outline icons or all filled icons, not mixed styles) and similar size. Colors used for text or shapes should complement each other (consider using the company’s official color palette or a professional infographic palette). Align text boxes neatly. If you used any graphics or shapes, make sure they are evenly distributed. A polished look enhances credibility.
    
-   **Final Check – Story Flow:** Finally, step back and look at the slide as a whole. The slide should tell a coherent story from left to right: _Initiation → Solution built and adopted → Dramatic efficiency gain → Full platform transformation_. The CIO should be able to read the title/vision to get the context, then follow the timeline from 2022 to 2025 seeing how each year contributed to the ultimate vision. The combination of clear headings, icons, and callout metrics will make the narrative easy to follow[visme.co](https://visme.co/blog/types-of-infographics/#:~:text=Pro%20Tip%3A%20Use%20visuals%20to,the%20timeline%20easy%20to%20follow). Remove any extraneous detail that doesn’t support this narrative.
    

By following these steps, you will create a compelling single-slide timeline that uses an **infographic-style layout** to effectively brief the CIO. The result will be a slide with clear visual anchors (icons, colors) and succinct callouts of measurable impact, presenting the Open Banking team’s journey and vision in a way that is both visually engaging and executive-friendly. Every element — from the title to the timeline and the callouts — works together to underscore the message of accelerated delivery and architecture transformation, aligned with business outcomes. This approach respects the CIO’s time and delivers the key insights **“quickly, with clarity”**[prezentium.com](https://prezentium.com/executive-presentations/#:~:text=Giving%20a%20successful%20presentation%20to,suite%20presentation), making for a powerful briefing slide.
