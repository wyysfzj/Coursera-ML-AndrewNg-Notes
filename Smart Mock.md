# Smart Mock Service Platform Presentation Script

\[Slide 1: Introduction] (30 seconds)
Good morning, everyone. Today, I'm excited to present a groundbreaking solution that's transforming our testing processes: the Smart Mock Service Platform. This innovation is set to revolutionize how we approach testing in our complex IT environment.

\[Slide 2: Current Challenges] (1 minute)
Let's start by acknowledging the challenges we face. Our IT landscape is complex, with numerous applications comprised of multiple components and various downstream and upstream systems. This complexity often leads to testing bottlenecks. We frequently encounter situations where different test environments aren't available simultaneously, or development progress varies across teams. These issues have been significant hurdles in our development and testing processes.

\[Slide 3: Traditional Approach and Limitations] (1 minute)
Traditionally, we've relied on wire mock to simulate downstream applications. However, this approach has several limitations. Developing mocks is time-consuming and inefficient, leading to additional development costs. Moreover, maintaining test cases and test data is cumbersome. These factors have impeded our ability to implement smooth end-to-end automation testing.

\[Slide 4: Introducing Smart Mock Service Platform] (1 minute)
To address these challenges, our IT Open Banking team has developed the Smart Mock Service Platform. As the name suggests, it offers a novel and efficient method for quickly building virtual endpoints to mimic services at any layer. A key feature is its support for dynamic test data, providing flexibility that was previously hard to achieve.

\[Slide 5: Smart Mock + Automation = Enhanced Efficiency] (30 seconds)
When we combine Smart Mock with our existing automation frameworks, we see a synergistic effect. The whole truly becomes greater than the sum of its parts, dramatically enhancing our testing efficiency.

\[Slide 6: Success Story - AU OB WSB] (1 minute)
Let me share a concrete example of the platform's impact. For the AU OB WSB project, which involves 2330 test cases, our team used Smart Mock to rebuild mock services for each downstream PAPI endpoint. The effort required was less than one-tenth of what would have been needed with wire mock. Even more impressively, we reduced our full regression testing time from five days to just 30-60 minutes, enabling daily full regression testing.

\[Slide 7: Demo 1 - Pipeline Execution] (1 minute)
Now, let's see Smart Mock in action. In this first demo, we'll initiate our pipeline and let it run. As you can see, the process is highly automated and efficient. This level of automation and speed was simply not possible with our previous methods.

\[Slide 8: Demo 2 - PAPI Get Accounts Service] (1 minute)
In our second demo, we'll show how Smart Mock mimics PAPI's get accounts service. Watch how it dynamically returns account numbers based on different usernames. The speed at which we can set this up and the flexibility in handling test data are key advantages of Smart Mock.

\[Slide 9: Demo 3 - Virtual Endpoint for User Token] (1 minute)
For our third demo, we'll demonstrate a virtual endpoint that simulates PAPI calling DPS to get a user token. This showcases how Smart Mock can interact seamlessly with real endpoints, providing a realistic testing environment.

\[Slide 10: Demo 4 - End-to-End Automation Testing] (1 minute)
In this final demo, we'll simulate an end-to-end automation test scenario where PAPI is temporarily unavailable. Using Smart Mock to mimic PAPI's get accounts functionality, we can complete the AU OB consent setup journey. This demonstrates how Smart Mock enables us to continue testing and development even when certain components are unavailable.

\[Slide 11: Adoption and Impact] (30 seconds)
The impact of Smart Mock extends beyond our team. Built initially by the Open Banking team, it has now been adopted by multiple teams across WSIT and WPB, showcasing its versatility and value across different projects and departments.

\[Slide 12: Conclusion] (30 seconds)
In conclusion, the Smart Mock Service Platform represents a significant leap forward in our testing capabilities. It addresses longstanding challenges in our development process, dramatically improves efficiency, and enables a level of automation we've long strived for. As we continue to expand its use, we anticipate even greater benefits in terms of development speed, cost reduction, and software quality. Thank you for your attention. Are there any questions?

This presentation script is designed to guide you through a 10-minute presentation to the CIO about the Smart Mock Service Platform. The script includes timings for each slide to help you pace your presentation effectively.

Here are a few tips for delivering this presentation:

1.  Practice the presentation to ensure you can comfortably cover all the material within the 10-minute timeframe.
2.  Be prepared to adjust your pace if needed, especially during the demo sections.
3.  Engage with your audience, making eye contact and using confident body language.
4.  Be ready to elaborate on any points if the CIO asks for more details.
5.  Consider having additional technical details on hand in case of in-depth questions.
