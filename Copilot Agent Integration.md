Enhancing your MCP/Copilot architecture to **mimic GPT-4.5 or GPT-O3's automatic internet search and reasoning behavior** involves creating an integrated system that intelligently decides when to search, fetches information dynamically, and then integrates that data into reasoning tasks.

Here's a comprehensive and actionable way to achieve this:

___

## üåü Enhanced Architecture Overview

You want your MCP/Copilot-based system to automatically:

1.  **Recognize when additional information is needed** (similar to GPT-4.5/O3 behavior).
    
2.  **Automatically trigger targeted internet searches** (via MCP/Agent).
    
3.  **Process retrieved information dynamically**.
    
4.  **Perform reasoning based on newly fetched data**.
    
5.  **Return coherent, reasoned results seamlessly within VSCode**.

## üö© Workflow Enhancement (Step-by-Step):

### **1\. Prompt Detection and Intent Recognition (VSCode & MCP)**

When the Business Analyst (BA) enters a prompt in VSCode, the Copilot-integrated extension or MCP backend first evaluates:

-   **Confidence:** Does existing context suffice?
    
-   **Gap Analysis:** Does this query imply missing details?
    

Use a simple pre-evaluation LLM call or a heuristic trigger based on keywords and prompt analysis:

**Example Heuristic (LLM Prompt):**

```
<div><p>vbnet</p><p><code><span><span>Does this query require up-</span><span><span>to</span></span><span>-</span><span><span>date</span></span><span> </span><span><span>or</span></span><span> external information </span><span><span>on</span></span><span> standards </span><span><span>like</span></span><span> OBIT, PSD2, </span><span><span>or</span></span><span> FDX beyond what </span><span><span>is</span></span><span> currently known?

</span><span><span>Prompt:</span></span><span> </span><span><span>"{User Prompt}"</span></span><span>

Respond </span><span><span>"YES"</span></span><span> </span><span><span>or</span></span><span> </span><span><span>"NO"</span></span><span> </span><span><span>with</span></span><span> a brief reason.
</span></span></code></p></div>
```

### **2\. Automatic Web Search via MCP/Agent**

If the answer to the heuristic is **YES**, the MCP/Agent automatically executes a targeted web search limited to your approved sites (PSD2, OBIT, FDX):

-   Implement **Semantic Search** (Bing Custom Search, Google Custom Search API, or specialized scraping with Playwright/Puppeteer).
    
-   Use **web content parsing and extraction** methods (LLM-assisted summarization) for relevance.
    

**Example Search Triggered:**

```
<div><p>sql</p><p><code><span><span><span>Search</span></span><span> Query: "PSD2 vs FDX 6.1 Account Information API differences site:fdx.org site:openbanking.org"
</span></span></code></p></div>
```

### **3\. Summarize and Structure Extracted Web Content**

The MCP then takes the raw results from searches and summarizes them into structured data suitable for reasoning:

-   **LLM-driven summarization (GPT-4.1/4o):** Create concise yet informative summaries.
    
-   Store extracted knowledge in structured form (Markdown, JSON, or knowledge graphs).
    

Example summarized output from MCP:

```
<div><p>markdown</p><p><code id="code-lang-markdown"><span><span><span>## Newly fetched content:</span></span><span>

</span><span><span>**FDX 6.1 (recent update):**</span></span><span>
</span><span><span>-</span></span><span> Introduced mandatory OAuth2 scopes for granular data access.
</span><span><span>-</span></span><span> Enhanced consent management via dashboards.

</span><span><span>**PSD2 updates (2024):**</span></span><span>
</span><span><span>-</span></span><span> Reinforced strong customer authentication (SCA) requirements.
</span><span><span>-</span></span><span> Added clarity on consent re-validation timelines.
</span></span></code></p></div>
```

### **4\. Dynamic Reasoning with Copilot (GPT-4.1/4o)**

With new information now available, MCP returns this to Copilot within VSCode. Copilot is given a dynamic prompt including:

-   **Original BA query**
    
-   **Newly fetched summaries**
    
-   **Contextual instructions to integrate both into reasoning**
    

**Example enhanced reasoning prompt:**

```
<div><p>markdown</p><p><code id="code-lang-markdown"><span><span>Given the user's query:
"Compare PSD2 and FDX 6.1 Account Information APIs"

New information retrieved:
</span><span><span>-</span></span><span> [Insert MCP summarized information here]

Combine this new information with existing knowledge. Perform detailed reasoning to compare PSD2 and FDX clearly, highlighting similarities, differences, and implementation implications.
</span></span></code></p></div>
```

### **5\. Direct Response to User in VSCode**

Copilot provides a structured, coherent analysis directly within the BA's VSCode editor, seamlessly integrating newly fetched content into the reasoning step.

## üìå Technical Implementation Details:

### üîß Heuristic for Determining Internet Search:

Use a lightweight **LLM inference call** to quickly check if an internet search is necessary:

-   **Simple API Call** to GPT-4.1 or GPT-4o endpoint:
    
    ```
    <div><p>python</p><p><code id="code-lang-python"><span><span>prompt = </span><span><span>f"Is external search needed for: '<span>{user_prompt}</span></span></span><span>'? Answer YES or NO."
    </span></span></code></p></div>
    ```
    
-   Rapid inference, minimal latency.
    

### üåê Semantic Web Search and Scraping:

-   **Playwright/Puppeteer:** Browser automation for reliable scraping.
    
-   **Custom Search APIs:** Google Custom Search or Bing Custom Search for highly accurate targeted searches.
    

### üìù Data Parsing and Summarization (GPT API):

Use GPT to produce concise yet meaningful structured summaries:

```
<div><p>python</p><p><code id="code-lang-python"><span><span>summary_prompt = </span><span><span>f"Summarize clearly and briefly the key points from: <span>{scraped_web_data}</span></span></span><span>"
</span></span></code></p></div>
```
