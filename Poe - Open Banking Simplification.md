Here is a refined version of the context in English:

There is an Open Banking system with a logical end-to-end architecture consisting of three layers. The first layer is the Open API layer, which hosts the open APIs that follow regular standards such as PSD2. The third layer is the core banking system, which provides real banking services such as accounts, CRM, payments, and more. The middle layer is called PAPI (Platform API), which consists of a set of microservices. The objective of PAPI is to map incoming open API requests to multiple core banking services and orchestrate the business processes by combining multiple core banking services. These three layers are owned by different teams: open banking, PAPI, and core banking. When there are new open banking requirements, the project team has to engage all three teams.

Previously, PAPI also served as the central middle layer between channels (including mobile, web, and open API) and core banking. However, due to a group-wide reorganization, there will no longer be a central PAPI team. Considering the unique characteristics and requirements of open banking, the plan is to transfer the responsibilities of PAPI from the PAPI team to the open banking team itself. This will simplify PAPI into a transformation and orchestration layer owned by open banking. Now you are the senior solution architect, the expert of microservice , and also the expert of open banking. Please provide your comment for the above proposal

As a senior solution architect and an expert in both microservices and open banking, I believe that the proposal to transfer the responsibilities of PAPI from the PAPI team to the open banking team has several advantages and some potential challenges to consider.

Advantages:

1.  Simplified governance: By having the open banking team own the PAPI layer, there will be a more streamlined decision-making process and faster implementation of new open banking requirements. This eliminates the need to coordinate between multiple teams for every change.
    
2.  Faster time-to-market: With the open banking team in charge of both the Open API layer and PAPI, they can more quickly adapt to new requirements and deliver solutions to the market. This is particularly important in the fast-paced open banking environment.
    
3.  Domain expertise: The open banking team has a deep understanding of the unique characteristics and requirements of open banking. By taking ownership of PAPI, they can ensure that the transformation and orchestration layer is tailored to the specific needs of open banking.
    

Challenges:

1.  Skill set adaptation: The open banking team may need to acquire additional skills and knowledge to effectively manage the PAPI layer. This might require training or hiring team members with experience in microservices architecture and orchestration.
    
2.  Increased responsibility: Taking on the PAPI layer will increase the workload and responsibility of the open banking team. They will need to ensure that they have sufficient resources and capacity to handle this additional work without compromising the quality of their deliverables.
    
3.  Coordination with core banking: Although the open banking team will own PAPI, they will still need to collaborate closely with the core banking team to ensure seamless integration and operation of the end-to-end architecture. Clear communication channels and processes should be established to facilitate this coordination.
    

Recommendations:

1.  Conduct a thorough assessment of the skills and resources needed within the open banking team to take on the PAPI responsibilities effectively. Provide necessary training and support to bridge any gaps.
    
2.  Establish clear ownership and governance models for the PAPI layer within the open banking team. Define roles, responsibilities, and decision-making processes to ensure smooth operation and maintainability of the PAPI microservices.
    
3.  Set up regular communication and collaboration channels with the core banking team to align on integration points, API contracts, and any changes that may impact the end-to-end architecture.
    
4.  Continuously monitor and optimize the performance and scalability of the PAPI layer to ensure it can handle the increasing demands of open banking.
    

Overall, the proposal to transfer PAPI responsibilities to the open banking team has the potential to simplify the architecture, improve agility, and enable faster delivery of open banking solutions. However, careful planning, skill set development, and ongoing collaboration with core banking will be critical to the success of this transition.

To make a clear choice between a central PAPI and an open banking-owned PAPI, let's evaluate the key factors and considerations for each option:

Central PAPI:  
Advantages:

1.  Consistent API design and governance across all channels (mobile, web, open API)
2.  Reusability of common functionalities and services across different channels
3.  Centralized management and maintenance of the PAPI layer

Disadvantages:

1.  Slower response to open banking-specific requirements due to dependencies on the central PAPI team
2.  Potential bottlenecks in development and deployment processes
3.  Increased complexity in coordination and communication between the open banking, PAPI, and core banking teams

Open Banking-Owned PAPI:  
Advantages:

1.  Faster response to open banking-specific requirements and changes
2.  Simplified governance and decision-making process within the open banking team
3.  Tailored design and optimization of the PAPI layer for open banking needs
4.  Reduced dependencies on other teams, enabling faster time-to-market

Disadvantages:

1.  Potential duplication of functionalities and services across different channels
2.  Increased responsibility and workload for the open banking team
3.  Need for additional skills and resources within the open banking team to manage the PAPI layer effectively

Considering the advantages and disadvantages of both options, my recommendation would be to proceed with the open banking-owned PAPI approach. This choice is based on the following key reasons:

1.  Open banking has unique characteristics and requirements that demand faster response times and more flexible adaptation to changes. An open banking-owned PAPI layer will enable the team to react more quickly to these needs without dependencies on a central team.
    
2.  The open banking landscape is evolving rapidly, and having a dedicated PAPI layer owned by the open banking team will allow for more agile development, testing, and deployment processes. This will help the organization stay competitive in the market.
    
3.  While there may be some duplication of functionalities across channels, the benefits of faster time-to-market and improved agility in open banking outweigh the potential drawbacks. The open banking team can still collaborate with other teams to identify and leverage common services where appropriate.
    
4.  The open banking team's domain expertise and understanding of the specific requirements will enable them to design and optimize the PAPI layer more effectively for open banking use cases.
    

To mitigate the challenges associated with an open banking-owned PAPI, the organization should invest in upskilling the open banking team, provide necessary resources and support, and establish clear communication and collaboration channels with the core banking team.

In summary, given the critical importance of agility and faster time-to-market in the open banking domain, an open banking-owned PAPI layer is the recommended approach. This will empower the open banking team to deliver value more quickly while still maintaining a cohesive end-to-end architecture in collaboration with the core banking team.

From an architectural perspective, let's dive deeper into the pros and cons of having an open banking-owned PAPI layer:

Pros:

1.  Domain-Driven Design (DDD): An open banking-owned PAPI layer allows for a more focused and domain-specific design of the microservices. The open banking team can design the PAPI services to closely align with the open banking domain, ensuring that the services are more cohesive and loosely coupled. This adherence to DDD principles can lead to a more maintainable and scalable architecture.
    
2.  Bounded Context: With an open banking-owned PAPI, the team can define clear bounded contexts for open banking-related services. This helps to encapsulate the specific business rules, data models, and services within the open banking domain, reducing the complexity of the overall system. It also minimizes the impact of changes in other contexts, such as the core banking system, on the open banking services.
    
3.  Autonomy and Flexibility: An open banking-owned PAPI gives the team more autonomy in designing, developing, and deploying microservices. They can make architectural decisions based on the specific needs of open banking without having to coordinate with a central PAPI team. This autonomy enables faster iterations, experimentation, and adaptation to changing requirements.
    
4.  Performance and Scalability: With a dedicated PAPI layer for open banking, the team can optimize the performance and scalability of the microservices based on the specific usage patterns and load requirements of open banking APIs. They can make decisions on caching, load balancing, and resource allocation that are tailored to open banking needs, ensuring a better user experience and system responsiveness.
    

Cons:

1.  Duplication and Consistency: Having a separate PAPI layer for open banking might lead to duplication of certain functionalities or services that are common across different channels. This duplication can increase maintenance efforts and the risk of inconsistencies. The open banking team will need to put extra effort into identifying and managing these common services to ensure consistency and avoid unnecessary duplication.
    
2.  Integration Complexity: With a separate PAPI layer, the integration between the open banking services and the core banking system might become more complex. The open banking team will need to establish clear contracts and interfaces with the core banking APIs and ensure that any changes in the core banking system are properly propagated to the PAPI layer. This requires robust integration testing and versioning strategies.
    
3.  Governance and Standards: Having a decentralized PAPI layer for open banking might lead to challenges in maintaining consistent API design, documentation, and governance standards across the organization. The open banking team will need to establish and adhere to clear guidelines and best practices to ensure that the PAPI services are properly designed, documented, and secured.
    
4.  Skillset and Resource Requirements: Managing a separate PAPI layer requires the open banking team to have the necessary skills and resources in microservices architecture, API design, and DevOps practices. The team might need to invest in training or hiring additional resources with expertise in these areas to effectively own and operate the PAPI layer.
    

In conclusion, from an architectural perspective, an open banking-owned PAPI layer offers several benefits, such as domain-driven design, clear bounded contexts, autonomy, and flexibility. However, it also introduces challenges related to duplication, consistency, integration complexity, and governance. The open banking team will need to weigh these pros and cons and put the necessary measures in place to mitigate the potential drawbacks. By doing so, they can leverage the benefits of a dedicated PAPI layer while ensuring a cohesive and maintainable architecture that supports the specific needs of open banking.

Certainly! Here's a simplified architecture diagram using PlantUML for the open banking system with an open banking-owned PAPI layer:

plantuml

Copy

```
<span>@startuml
</span>skinparam componentStyle rectangle

package "Open Banking System" {
    component "Open API Layer" as OpenAPI
    component "PAPI Layer (Open Banking Owned)" as PAPI
    component "Core Banking System" as CoreBanking

    OpenAPI --&gt; PAPI
    PAPI --&gt; CoreBanking
}

package "External Systems" {
    component "Third-Party Applications" as ThirdParty
    component "Partner Banks" as PartnerBanks
}

ThirdParty --&gt; OpenAPI

```

This diagram represents the high-level architecture of the open banking system with the following components:

1.  Open API Layer: This layer exposes the open banking APIs to external systems such as third-party applications and partner banks. It follows standard protocols like PSD2 and handles authentication, authorization, and API management.
    
2.  PAPI Layer (Open Banking Owned): This is the middle layer owned by the open banking team. It consists of microservices that transform and orchestrate the requests from the Open API layer to the Core Banking System. The open banking team has full ownership and control over this layer.
    
3.  Core Banking System: This layer represents the existing core banking services, such as accounts, CRM, payments, and more. It provides the actual banking functionalities and integrates with the PAPI layer.
    
4.  External Systems: These are the external entities that interact with the open banking system, including third-party applications and partner banks. They consume the open banking APIs exposed by the Open API Layer.
    

The arrows in the diagram indicate the flow of requests and data between the components. Requests from external systems come through the Open API Layer, which then interacts with the PAPI Layer. The PAPI Layer, in turn, communicates with the Core Banking System to fulfill the requested banking functionalities.

By having the PAPI Layer owned by the open banking team, they can design, develop, and deploy microservices specifically tailored to the needs of open banking. This allows for faster iteration, better alignment with the open banking domain, and more flexibility in managing the transformation and orchestration of requests.

Please note that this is a simplified representation of the architecture, and in real-world scenarios, there would be additional components, such as security layers, monitoring systems, and more, depending on the specific requirements of the open banking system.
