## Comparison of FDX 6.1 vs OBIE (UK Open Banking), PSD2 (EU), and Australian CDR

Open banking and open finance frameworks around the world share a common goal – enabling secure, consumer-permissioned access to financial data – but they differ in origin, scope, and technical standards. Below is a comprehensive comparison of **FDX 6.1** (Financial Data Exchange’s API standard) with the UK’s **OBIE** (Open Banking Implementation Entity standard), the EU’s **PSD2** regime, and Australia’s **Consumer Data Right (CDR)**. We examine their regulatory foundations, geographic scope, API design, data models, security/authentication, consent mechanisms, market adoption, and efforts toward interoperability. A summary table is provided at the end for quick reference.

## Regulatory Frameworks and Governance

-   **FDX 6.1 (Financial Data Exchange):** FDX is an industry-led, non-profit standards body founded in 2018 (as a successor to the FS-ISAC Durable Data API initiative)[nvlpubs.nist.gov](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2022/NIST.IR.8389-draft.pdf#:~:text=Data%20Exchange%20,to%20%E2%80%9Cunify%E2%80%9D%20the%20financial%20industry)[nvlpubs.nist.gov](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2022/NIST.IR.8389-draft.pdf#:~:text=723%20migrate%20to%20the%20FDX,API%20specification%20is%20not%20openly). It is not mandated by government regulation but rather driven by a consortium of over 200 financial institutions, fintechs, data aggregators, and tech firms across the U.S. and Canada[openbankingexpo.com](https://www.openbankingexpo.com/news/fdx-api-adoption-hits-114m-customer-connections/#:~:text=FDX%20is%20a%20standard,more%20than%20200%20member%20organisations). Governance is through a board of directors representing diverse stakeholders[mx.com](https://www.mx.com/blog/why-fdx-matters/#:~:text=FDX%20is%20governed%20by%20a,the%20FDX%20Board%20of%20Directors). In 2023, the U.S. CFPB formally recognized FDX as a standard-setting organization as it prepares open banking rules under Dodd-Frank Section 1033[openbankingexpo.com](https://www.openbankingexpo.com/news/fdx-api-adoption-hits-114m-customer-connections/#:~:text=parties%20and%20may%20offer%20less,customer%20control%E2%80%9D). However, FDX standards remain _voluntary_ (at least until any future CFPB rule references them) and evolve through industry collaboration rather than regulatory mandate.
    
-   **OBIE (UK Open Banking):** The OBIE standards were born from a 2016 order by the UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) requiring the nine largest banks (the “CMA9”) to develop a common open banking API to spur competition[openbankingmap.com](https://www.openbankingmap.com/#:~:text=Timeline%3A). OBIE (Open Banking Implementation Entity, now Open Banking Ltd.) was set up as the governing entity to draft the standards, manage the open banking directory, and oversee implementation – funded by the banks but under supervision of the CMA and UK regulators[openbankingmap.com](https://www.openbankingmap.com/#:~:text=Status%3AOperational%20Framework%3AOpen%20Banking%20UK%2C%20CMA%2C,Use%20cases)[openbankingmap.com](https://www.openbankingmap.com/#:~:text=Documents%3A). UK open banking is _regulatory-driven_: the CMA Order and PSD2 (implemented in UK law) made compliance mandatory for banks, with the OBIE standards essentially required for the CMA9 and forming the de facto baseline for others. Governance is now transitioning to a new service company and oversight committee to expand into Open Finance, but during 2018–2021 OBIE was the central authority managing the ecosystem[nvlpubs.nist.gov](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2022/NIST.IR.8389-draft.pdf#:~:text=480%20With%20the%20CMA%20order%E2%80%99s,28%5D.%20Similarly%2C%20the)[nvlpubs.nist.gov](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2022/NIST.IR.8389-draft.pdf#:~:text=independent%20of%20the%20U,example%2C%20in%20October%202020%2C%20the).
    
-   **PSD2 (EU):** The EU’s Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD2), effective 2018, is a _pan-European regulation_ that compels banks in the EU/EEA to provide licensed third-party providers (TPPs) access to payment account data and payment initiation under defined rules[openbankingmap.com](https://www.openbankingmap.com/#:~:text=Status%3AOperational%20Framework%3A%20Payment%20Services%20Directive,Type%3ARegulation%20Banks%3ABanks%20implementing%20OpenBanking%20in)[openbankingmap.com](https://www.openbankingmap.com/#:~:text=,see%20more%20details%20here). PSD2 is a legal framework, not a single technical standard – the European Banking Authority (EBA) set high-level requirements (including _Regulatory Technical Standards_ for security/SCA[openbankingmap.com](https://www.openbankingmap.com/#:~:text=,Webinar%20on%20PSD3%20and%20FIDA)), but banks and industry groups crafted their own API specifications to comply[openbankingmap.com](https://www.openbankingmap.com/#:~:text=API%20Specs%3ARegulation%20only%20provides%20abstract,adopted%20specs%20have%20formed). Two dominant standards emerged: the **Berlin Group’s** NextGenPSD2 API (adopted by ~70–80% of EU banks[nvlpubs.nist.gov](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2022/NIST.IR.8389-draft.pdf#:~:text=456%20the%20EU,24%5D.%20Nonetheless%2C%20the)[nvlpubs.nist.gov](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2022/NIST.IR.8389-draft.pdf#:~:text=457%20NextGenPSD2%20standard%2C%20STET%E2%80%99s%20PSD2,as%20a%20pioneer%20and%20ongoing)) and France’s **STET** API, among others[openbankingmap.com](https://www.openbankingmap.com/#:~:text=API%20Specs%3ARegulation%20only%20provides%20abstract,adopted%20specs%20have%20formed). No central implementation entity exists in the EU; each bank is overseen by its national regulator for compliance, and TPPs are authorized via national authorities. Thus, PSD2 governance is _fragmented_: legally enforceable across ~30 countries, but with multiple standards and no single industry consortium like OBIE or FDX for the whole region.
    
-   **Australian CDR (ACCC’s Consumer Data Right):** Australia’s CDR is a _legislated data-sharing framework_ that began with open banking and extends to other sectors[openbankingmap.com](https://www.openbankingmap.com/#:~:text=Australia)[openbankingmap.com](https://www.openbankingmap.com/#:~:text=accounts%2C%20credit%20card%20accounts%2C%20mortgage,Other%20industries%20to%20follow). Enacted in 2019, it is enforced by the ACCC (Australian Competition & Consumer Commission) with input from the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (privacy regulator). A Data Standards Body (originally Data61/CSIRO, now the Data Standards Australia team) develops the technical standards, which are legally binding on data holders (banks, energy companies, etc.) via CDR rules[openbankingmap.com](https://www.openbankingmap.com/#:~:text=,CDR%20documents). Governance is top-down: banks had phased compliance deadlines from 2020–2021 based on size[openbankingmap.com](https://www.openbankingmap.com/#:~:text=shared%20www). The ACCC manages accreditation of data recipients and ensures compliance. In summary, CDR is a _strict regulatory regime_, with government-defined rules and standards, overseen by multiple agencies, aiming to eventually cover the entire economy’s consumer data sharing.
    

## Geographic Scope and Legal Enforceability

-   **FDX:** Primarily focused on North America (United States and Canada)[openbankingexpo.com](https://www.openbankingexpo.com/news/fdx-api-adoption-hits-114m-customer-connections/#:~:text=In%20a%20press%20statement%2C%20the,%E2%80%9Cimprove%20interoperability%20when%20they%20integrate%E2%80%9D)[openbankingexpo.com](https://www.openbankingexpo.com/news/fdx-api-adoption-hits-114m-customer-connections/#:~:text=FDX%20is%20a%20standard,more%20than%20200%20member%20organisations). Use of the FDX API is voluntary and not mandated by law, though it’s becoming a de facto standard in the U.S. open finance market. FDX standards have no legal enforceability on their own; they rely on market adoption. That said, U.S. regulators (CFPB) are in the process of introducing open banking rules, and FDX is positioned as a likely technical standard under that future regime[openbankingexpo.com](https://www.openbankingexpo.com/news/fdx-api-adoption-hits-114m-customer-connections/#:~:text=parties%20and%20may%20offer%20less,customer%20control%E2%80%9D). In Canada, FDX is also influential as the country develops its open banking framework (the _Digital Governance Standards Institute in Canada aligns with FDX_ efforts[openbankingmap.com](https://www.openbankingmap.com/#:~:text=%2A%202023,with%20implementation%20in%20the%20USA)[openbankingmap.com](https://www.openbankingmap.com/#:~:text=release%20www,04%3A%20Implementation%20Deadline%202)). In short: FDX’s geographic scope is international in membership but **rooted in U.S./Canadian markets**, without direct legal mandates (yet).
    
-   **UK (OBIE):** Covers the United Kingdom. The OBIE standard was mandatory for the CMA9 banks and strongly encouraged (effectively adopted) by other UK payment account providers to meet PSD2 obligations[openbankingmap.com](https://www.openbankingmap.com/#:~:text=Type%3ARegulation%20Banks%3ABanks%20implementing%20OpenBanking%20API,Use%20cases)[openbankingmap.com](https://www.openbankingmap.com/#:~:text=,API%20Specs%2C%20Security%20Profiles%2C%20etc). Legal enforceability comes via the CMA Order (for the biggest banks) and via UK regulations transposing PSD2 for all banks. Thus, in the UK virtually all payment account providers (~90% of the market) implemented open banking APIs by 2019[openbankingmap.com](https://www.openbankingmap.com/#:~:text=Type%3ARegulation%20Banks%3ABanks%20implementing%20OpenBanking%20API,Use%20cases). The OBIE specs are not written into law but were **endorsed by regulators** as the industry standard, making them quasi-mandatory. Geographic scope is just the UK (post-Brexit, UK open banking is separate from EU PSD2, though originally based on it).
    
-   **EU (PSD2):** Covers all EU and EEA member states (over two dozen countries). PSD2 is **legally binding** on all payment account providers in these countries[openbankingmap.com](https://www.openbankingmap.com/#:~:text=Status%3AOperational%20Framework%3A%20Payment%20Services%20Directive,Type%3ARegulation%20Banks%3ABanks%20implementing%20OpenBanking%20in)[openbankingmap.com](https://www.openbankingmap.com/#:~:text=%2A%202015,published). However, because PSD2 did not prescribe one technical standard, each bank could choose an API approach (or even a modified customer interface in rare cases). In practice, most banks use one of the common frameworks (Berlin Group, STET, etc.), leading to country-by-country differences[nvlpubs.nist.gov](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2022/NIST.IR.8389-draft.pdf#:~:text=456%20the%20EU,24%5D.%20Nonetheless%2C%20the)[nvlpubs.nist.gov](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2022/NIST.IR.8389-draft.pdf#:~:text=458%20Although%20approximately%2078%20,Index%202021%20has%20recently%20ranked). Enforceability is high – regulators can fine banks for non-compliance – but _geographic consistency_ is lower than the UK, since Europe ended up with multiple standards. PSD2’s scope is _limited to payment accounts_ (like checking/current accounts, credit cards, etc.), not covering other financial products like investments or loans[nvlpubs.nist.gov](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2022/NIST.IR.8389-draft.pdf#:~:text=469%204,data%20access%20to%20a%20broader)[nvlpubs.nist.gov](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2022/NIST.IR.8389-draft.pdf#:~:text=payment%20data%20by%20471%20ASPSPs,than%20the%20licensed%20payment%20service) (those are being considered under future initiatives like PSD3/Open Finance).
    
-   **Australia (CDR):** National scope (Australia). Compliance is _mandatory_ for designated sectors. It started with the Big 4 banks in July 2020 and rolled out to all banks by mid-2021[openbankingmap.com](https://www.openbankingmap.com/#:~:text=%2A%202019,in%20force%20in%20telco%20sector). Unlike PSD2, which is confined to payments, Australia’s open banking under CDR includes a wider range of banking products (savings, term deposits, credit cards, mortgages, etc.) and is expanding to industries like energy and telecommunications[openbankingmap.com](https://www.openbankingmap.com/#:~:text=Scope%3A). Legal enforceability is strict – the ACCC can impose penalties for breaches. Each sector’s rollout is staged by government timelines. Notably, as of 2023, write-access (like payment initiation) is not yet enabled in the banking CDR; it’s focused on data sharing[openbankingmap.com](https://www.openbankingmap.com/#:~:text=Use%20cases%3A). Geographic scope is just Australia, but the CDR model is often noted as pioneering a cross-sector “Open Data” regime beyond banking.
    

## API Specifications: Design, Structure, and Versioning

All four frameworks rely on **RESTful APIs with JSON** data format as the core design for data sharing, but there are nuances in how their APIs are specified and evolve:

-   **FDX 6.1:** The FDX API is a comprehensive _open finance_ API specification with a broad set of endpoints covering many financial data domains. It is defined in a version-controlled standard (v6.1 is the latest minor release, following v6.0 in late 2023) and updated roughly twice per year through member working groups[globenewswire.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/12/21/2800371/0/en/Financial-Data-Exchange-FDX-Announces-Release-of-FDX-API-v6-0-featuring-Revolutionary-Updates-for-Open-Finance-Data-Sharing.html#:~:text=FDX%20API%20updates%2C%20released%20twice,standards%20to%20meet%20market%20needs). FDX’s API is RESTful and uses JSON payloads (its precursor, the OFX standard, was XML, but FDX fully embraced JSON/REST)[nvlpubs.nist.gov](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2022/NIST.IR.8389-draft.pdf#:~:text=718%20data%2C%E2%80%9D%20known%20as%20the,joined%20FDX%20as%20an%20independent). The API endpoints are organized by functional “resource” categories – for example: accounts, balances, transactions, investments, loans, etc., each with sub-resources. FDX 6.x introduced new endpoints beyond core banking: e.g. _payroll data_ endpoints for income/employment verification[globenewswire.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/12/21/2800371/0/en/Financial-Data-Exchange-FDX-Announces-Release-of-FDX-API-v6-0-featuring-Revolutionary-Updates-for-Open-Finance-Data-Sharing.html#:~:text=financial%20institution%20%28NFI%29.%20,VOI%29%20information) and even an account **opening/onboarding** use-case to simplify new account setup[globenewswire.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/12/21/2800371/0/en/Financial-Data-Exchange-FDX-Announces-Release-of-FDX-API-v6-0-featuring-Revolutionary-Updates-for-Open-Finance-Data-Sharing.html#:~:text=,the%20first%20data%20structures%20to). Versioning: FDX versions its API standard (major.minor), and implementations align to a given version. Backwards compatibility is considered, but as an industry standard, participants typically migrate as new versions bring enhancements (v6.0 added two-way notifications, new data types, etc.[globenewswire.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/12/21/2800371/0/en/Financial-Data-Exchange-FDX-Announces-Release-of-FDX-API-v6-0-featuring-Revolutionary-Updates-for-Open-Finance-Data-Sharing.html#:~:text=RESTON%2C%20Va,of%20the%20FAPI%20security%20schema)[globenewswire.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/12/21/2800371/0/en/Financial-Data-Exchange-FDX-Announces-Release-of-FDX-API-v6-0-featuring-Revolutionary-Updates-for-Open-Finance-Data-Sharing.html#:~:text=,VOI)). Being industry-driven, FDX can iterate quickly and add features like _fraud alerts messaging and two-way data sharing_ (e.g. data recipients sending notifications back to providers)[globenewswire.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/12/21/2800371/0/en/Financial-Data-Exchange-FDX-Announces-Release-of-FDX-API-v6-0-featuring-Revolutionary-Updates-for-Open-Finance-Data-Sharing.html#:~:text=Here%20are%20a%20few%20new,0). In summary, FDX’s API spec is **modern REST/JSON**, with rich endpoint coverage and frequent version updates reflecting evolving open finance needs.
    
-   **UK OBIE:** The OBIE Read/Write API is a RESTful JSON API defined by the OBIE’s specifications (which reached version 3.1.+). The API is structured around resources like **Accounts**, **Transactions**, **Beneficiaries**, **Direct Debits**, **Standing Orders**, **Scheduled Payments** for account information (AIS), and endpoints for **Payments** (PIS) such as domestic payments, international payments, file payments, etc.[openbankingmap.com](https://www.openbankingmap.com/#:~:text=API%20Specs%3AOpen%20API%20files%2C%20usage,Use%20cases)[openbankingmap.com](https://www.openbankingmap.com/#:~:text=,API%20Specs%2C%20Security%20Profiles%2C%20etc). Each resource has a well-defined schema (OBIE provided a data dictionary) largely aligned to banking standards (ISO 20022 where possible). For instance, an `/accounts` endpoint returns account details including identifiers (IBAN or sort code/account number for UK), balances, account type, etc., while `/accounts/{id}/transactions` returns transaction lists with fields like amount, date, description, merchant (if available), and categorization codes. The OBIE API is _versioned_ (e.g., v3.1.10 as of 2021) but changes after v3 have been incremental and backward-compatible. OBIE also defined **extensions** (for example, the inclusion of new account types like credit cards and prepaid cards was an extension to the standards in 2018[openbanking.org.uk](https://www.openbanking.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Open-Banking-September-Infographic.pdf#:~:text=,in%20all%20currencies%20and)). The OBIE specifications include not just OpenAPI definitions for endpoints but also customer experience guidelines and operational rules[openbanking.org.uk](https://www.openbanking.org.uk/news/category/impact-report/#:~:text=,Dedicated%20interfaces)[openbanking.org.uk](https://www.openbanking.org.uk/news/category/impact-report/#:~:text=Operational%20guidelines%20,CIBA%29%20Security%20profiles). In practice, nearly all UK implementations follow the OBIE spec structure, which results in high consistency across banks in terms of endpoints and request/response formats.
    
-   **PSD2 (EU APIs):** PSD2 itself did not prescribe a single API; however, most European banks chose one of a few standard RESTful API frameworks. The **Berlin Group’s NextGenPSD2** is a prominent spec: it defines endpoints like `GET /accounts`, `GET /accounts/{id}/transactions` and payment initiation endpoints (e.g. `POST /payments/sepa-credit-transfers`) with JSON payloads, similar in broad structure to OBIE. Berlin Group, however, introduces an explicit concept of a **“consent object”** or **“authorization object”** – an extra step where a TPP must POST a request to create a consent resource (outlining the requested access scope, such as which accounts and data) and obtain an ID, before redirecting the user for authorization[openbankingmap.com](https://www.openbankingmap.com/#:~:text=API%20Specs%3ARegulation%20only%20provides%20abstract,adopted%20specs%20have%20formed)[openbankingmap.com](https://www.openbankingmap.com/#:~:text=,see%20more%20details%20here). This results in endpoints like `POST /consents` and `GET /consents/{id}` which have no direct equivalent in OBIE’s AIS (since OBIE handled consent via OAuth scopes rather than a separate resource). The French STET spec similarly uses REST/JSON with its own schema variations. Both Berlin and STET aligned data fields with ISO20022 naming conventions (e.g., using structured address and purpose codes for payments)[openid.net](https://openid.net/wordpress-content/uploads/2023/01/OIDF-Whitepaper_Open-Banking-and-Open-Data-Ready-to-Cross-Borders_Final.pdf#:~:text=%28FDX%29%20%28US%20and%20Canada%29,although%20some). _Versioning:_ Berlin Group releases versions (e.g. v1.3 in 2019, v1.3.9 in 2021, etc.), and banks in those networks update accordingly. Because multiple standards exist in the EU, there is variability – for example, the API path structures and naming can differ slightly between Berlin Group vs. STET. Nonetheless, the core approach (RESTful endpoints for accounts, transactions, balances, and payment orders) is consistent across PSD2. It’s worth noting PSD2 APIs were _initially minimalistic_ (just fulfilling regulatory requirements), often lacking some richer features found in OBIE or FDX (e.g., OBIE defined a financial transaction categorization field and a mechanism for webhook notifications of events, whereas many PSD2 APIs did not originally have webhooks). The EU is now working on an _API Access Scheme_ to harmonize standards further under PSD3/FIDA proposals[nvlpubs.nist.gov](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2022/NIST.IR.8389-draft.pdf#:~:text=465%20services%29%20,regulates%20only%20the%20sharing%20of)[nvlpubs.nist.gov](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2022/NIST.IR.8389-draft.pdf#:~:text=466%20begin%20work%20on%20a,of%20data%20related%20to%20loans).
    
-   **Australian CDR:** The banking APIs under CDR are RESTful and JSON-based, documented in publicly available standards (with OpenAPI specifications)[openbankingmap.com](https://www.openbankingmap.com/#:~:text=Driver%3AAustralian%20Competition%20and%20Consumer%20Commission,but%20not%20enforced%20Use%20cases). The CDR defines endpoints for account data sharing very much like OBIE/PSD2: e.g., `GET /banking/accounts` (list of accounts available for sharing), `GET /banking/accounts/{accountId}` (account detail), `GET /banking/accounts/{id}/transactions` for transactions, as well as others for specific data clusters (direct debits, payees, products, etc.) as required by the rules[openbankingmap.com](https://www.openbankingmap.com/#:~:text=,Other%20industries%20to%20follow). One difference is CDR’s _broader product scope_: the API covers not just deposit accounts but also credit cards, loans, mortgages, etc. as “account” types, each with relevant fields[openbankingmap.com](https://www.openbankingmap.com/#:~:text=,Other%20industries%20to%20follow). The CDR has a **uniform schema** that data holders must implement, and it is versioned (the Data Standards Body updates the standards; for example, new fields or resources can be added in version releases). As of early 2022, write/payments were not supported (the API is “read-only” for consumers’ data)[openbankingmap.com](https://www.openbankingmap.com/#:~:text=Use%20cases%3A), so there are no payment initiation endpoints yet in the banking CDR. Another noteworthy aspect: CDR APIs include some endpoints for _consent and consumer dashboards_ indirectly (consent management is largely handled via central registers and out-of-band mechanisms, but data holders must provide endpoints for consumers to manage consents, accessible via the bank’s interface rather than an open API). In summary, CDR’s API is similar in design to OBIE’s (indeed, New Zealand’s Open Banking spec explicitly based itself on OBIE’s design[openbankingmap.com](https://www.openbankingmap.com/#:~:text=Documents%3A)), but covering more account types and standardized across multiple banks by law.
    

## Data Models and Standard Data Objects

**Scope of Data:** One major differentiator is the breadth of data each framework covers:

-   **FDX (Open Finance scope):** FDX’s data model is expansive. It not only covers traditional bank account information (checking/savings accounts, transaction history, balances) but extends into _investment accounts, loans, credit cards, mortgages, tax forms, business finance_, and as of v6.0 even _payroll and employment data_[globenewswire.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/12/21/2800371/0/en/Financial-Data-Exchange-FDX-Announces-Release-of-FDX-API-v6-0-featuring-Revolutionary-Updates-for-Open-Finance-Data-Sharing.html#:~:text=RESTON%2C%20Va,of%20the%20FAPI%20security%20schema)[globenewswire.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/12/21/2800371/0/en/Financial-Data-Exchange-FDX-Announces-Release-of-FDX-API-v6-0-featuring-Revolutionary-Updates-for-Open-Finance-Data-Sharing.html#:~:text=financial%20institution%20%28NFI%29.%20,VOI%29%20information). This reflects an “open finance” approach – the idea that any financial data (from any account or product type) can be standardized and shared with user permission[mx.com](https://www.mx.com/blog/why-fdx-matters/#:~:text=Open%20Finance%20%20enables%20access,solutions%20to%20improve%20financial%20wellness). FDX builds on what was called the “Durable Data Definition” – essentially a comprehensive JSON schema for financial data that evolved from earlier standards[nvlpubs.nist.gov](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2022/NIST.IR.8389-draft.pdf#:~:text=718%20data%2C%E2%80%9D%20known%20as%20the,joined%20FDX%20as%20an%20independent). For example, FDX defines objects for _DepositAccount_ (with fields for account number, routing number, balance, etc.), _CreditAccount_, _InvestmentHolding_, _LoanAccount_, _TaxDocument_, etc., each with detailed subfields. The data model aims to be interoperable but is also tailored to North American financial conventions (e.g., including ACH routing transit numbers, US tax form fields, etc.). FDX does leverage global standards where possible (ISO currency codes, transaction type codes) but is somewhat **proprietary in structure** – it originated from industry needs and existing aggregator data formats, rather than directly from ISO20022. Notably, FDX’s model aligns with **OFX** in heritage (OFX joined FDX as a working group[nvlpubs.nist.gov](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2022/NIST.IR.8389-draft.pdf#:~:text=718%20data%2C%E2%80%9D%20known%20as%20the,joined%20FDX%20as%20an%20independent)[nvlpubs.nist.gov](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2022/NIST.IR.8389-draft.pdf#:~:text=723%20migrate%20to%20the%20FDX,API%20specification%20is%20not%20openly)) and is continually refined by working groups to ensure all common data elements (like categorization of transactions, merchant info, etc.) are accounted for. In practice, this means FDX can transmit richer data for a broader set of accounts than a pure open banking (PSD2) scope, moving toward a full financial picture (open finance).
    
-   **OBIE (UK Open Banking Data):** OBIE’s standard data model was initially limited to **payment accounts** – mainly personal and business current accounts. Over time it was extended to cover some additional account types like credit cards and e-wallets in all currencies[openbanking.org.uk](https://www.openbanking.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Open-Banking-September-Infographic.pdf#:~:text=,in%20all%20currencies%20and). The OBIE schemas for resources were largely derived from ISO 20022 definitions and UK-specific needs. For example, an OBIE **Account** object includes account identifiers (IBAN, or UK-specific sort code & account number), account type (e.g., CurrentAccount, CreditCard, Loan), currency, account holder name, etc. **Transaction** objects include fields such as transaction amount, date, description, merchant name (if available), and a **credit/debit indicator**, along with a transaction _category code_ and _transaction information_ that align with ISO standards[openid.net](https://openid.net/wordpress-content/uploads/2023/01/OIDF-Whitepaper_Open-Banking-and-Open-Data-Ready-to-Cross-Borders_Final.pdf#:~:text=%28FDX%29%20%28US%20and%20Canada%29,although%20some). OBIE also defined data objects for **ScheduledPayment**, **StandingOrder**, **DirectDebit** – allowing third parties to retrieve information about recurring payments arrangements on the account. For payment initiation, OBIE’s model defines objects like **DomesticPaymentRequest** and **DomesticPaymentResponse** carrying all required fields (creditor account, amount, reference, etc.), closely mapping to the underlying payment systems in the UK. Overall, the OBIE data model is narrower in scope than FDX – focused on banking/payment data – but deep in detail for those domains. It ensured uniformity in how data like transaction narratives or balance types are represented across UK banks.
    
-   **PSD2 (EU Data Models):** Under PSD2, because there are multiple standards, there isn’t a single unified data model across Europe – but commonalities exist. The Berlin Group’s data model, for instance, mirrors ISO20022 for payments (PSU – Payment Service User – data, account data, etc.) and covers similar ground to OBIE for AIS: account list (with IBAN, BBAN, etc.), balances (available vs booked), transactions (with ISO transaction codes, remittance info, etc.). PSD2’s required data scope is strictly _payment accounts_ (so, current accounts, card accounts, etc. – no investments or mortgages)[nvlpubs.nist.gov](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2022/NIST.IR.8389-draft.pdf#:~:text=469%204,data%20access%20to%20a%20broader). Some national implementations went a bit further (for example, banks in some countries voluntarily offer mortgage or loan data via APIs, but it’s not mandated by PSD2). One difference in data model emphasis: PSD2 (via EBA guidelines) required **availability of funds checks** (CAF) for card-based payments, so API data models include an object for confirming funds on an account[openbankingmap.com](https://www.openbankingmap.com/#:~:text=Use%20cases%3A) – OBIE and others have this too, but it was especially highlighted as a PSD2 use-case. Another nuance: **multi-currency accounts** – European accounts can be multi-currency, and Berlin Group spec includes data structures to handle that, whereas OBIE mostly assumed one currency per account (though could list multiple accounts). By and large, OBIE and Berlin Group aligned many object definitions (partly through mutual influence and both looking to ISO standards)[openid.net](https://openid.net/wordpress-content/uploads/2023/01/OIDF-Whitepaper_Open-Banking-and-Open-Data-Ready-to-Cross-Borders_Final.pdf#:~:text=,although%20some). Thus, the differences are more in specific field naming or optional fields. For example, OBIE might have `TransactionInformation` field for the transaction description, whereas Berlin might call it `remittanceInformationUnstructured` in its schema – serving similar purpose. Both include things like transaction category or purpose codes, though usage may vary. In summary, PSD2-linked data models are **fragmented but converging** around common industry data dictionaries (ISO20022 terms, etc.), limited to the payments domain.
    
-   **Australian CDR:** The CDR banking data model is relatively broad within banking. It includes deposit accounts (savings, checking), credit cards, mortgages, personal loans, and even leasing accounts – essentially **all retail banking products** are in scope for data sharing[openbankingmap.com](https://www.openbankingmap.com/#:~:text=,Other%20industries%20to%20follow). The standard defines objects for each account type. For example, an account has a property indicating its product category (TRANSAC, TERM\_DEP, RESIDENTIAL\_MORTGAGE, etc.), and there are endpoints to fetch richer product details (like interest rates, fees – a lot of “product reference data” is available as part of CDR)[openbankingmap.com](https://www.openbankingmap.com/#:~:text=,Other%20industries%20to%20follow). Transaction data in CDR includes similar info (amount, description, etc.), and must be tagged with standardized category codes where possible. Additionally, CDR requires sharing of customer data (e.g., customer’s basic info, contact details) and payee details. One notable element: because CDR is broader, it also defines data models for **non-banking sectors** (energy, telecom), but those are separate from banking APIs. Within banking, the data model was influenced by OBIE – e.g., CDR adopts a common structure for transactions and accounts that parallels OBIE’s while adjusting for Australian context (such as BSB numbers for domestic account routing, which are Australia’s equivalent of sort codes). Moreover, the CDR model and endpoints explicitly categorize data into “data clusters” which map to consent permissions (accounts, transactions, direct debits, scheduled payments, etc.), ensuring fine-grained control (discussed more under Consent).
    

**Summary of Data Scope:** FDX offers **open-finance breadth** (covering banking, investments, insurance, tax, etc. as data categories), whereas OBIE and PSD2 are focused on **open-banking core** (payment accounts and payments). Australia’s CDR sits somewhat in between – within banking it covers more product types than PSD2/OBIE (e.g., mortgages are included in CDR’s read scope, whereas PSD2 didn’t mandate mortgage data)[openbankingmap.com](https://www.openbankingmap.com/#:~:text=,Other%20industries%20to%20follow)[nvlpubs.nist.gov](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2022/NIST.IR.8389-draft.pdf#:~:text=469%204,data%20access%20to%20a%20broader), and CDR ultimately is expanding to non-bank data too, but the question’s context is banking. Data field standards tend to overlap (all use ISO currency codes, similar date formats, etc.), yet each standard has its own schema definitions and naming conventions, which means integration across regimes requires mapping. For example, a “Balance” in FDX might have fields for “availableBalance” and “currentBalance”, while OBIE has “AvailableBalance” and “BookedBalance” with similar meaning; a minor difference in naming that needs mapping if one were to translate between the two.

## Security Protocols and Authentication Methods

All these frameworks emphasize **strong security and customer authentication**, but their exact approaches reflect different needs and evolutions. Common to all is reliance on OAuth 2.0 and related profiles for authorization, with the user’s bank performing strong customer authentication (SCA).

-   **FDX 6.1 (Security):** FDX’s security specification has converged on the OAuth 2.0 **“authorization code” flow with PKCE**, in line with the OpenID Foundation’s Financial-grade API (**FAPI**) standards[financialdataexchange.org](https://www.financialdataexchange.org/FDX/FDX/News/Announcements/FDX_Security_Specification_Boosted_with_FAPI.aspx#:~:text=FDX%27s%20Financial,0%20Advanced%20and%20CIBA%20protocols). In fact, FDX’s security spec v3.4 (paired with FDX API v5) explicitly _references and recommends FAPI 1.0 Advanced Profile and CIBA (decoupled auth)_[financialdataexchange.org](https://www.financialdataexchange.org/FDX/FDX/News/Announcements/FDX_Security_Specification_Boosted_with_FAPI.aspx#:~:text=FDX%27s%20Financial,0%20Advanced%20and%20CIBA%20protocols). By FDX 6.0, the standard fully incorporated the FAPI security scheme as normative[globenewswire.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/12/21/2800371/0/en/Financial-Data-Exchange-FDX-Announces-Release-of-FDX-API-v6-0-featuring-Revolutionary-Updates-for-Open-Finance-Data-Sharing.html#:~:text=version%20of%20the%20API%20includes,of%20the%20FAPI%20security%20schema). Practically, this means FDX-enabled data sharing works like this: a third-party (data recipient) redirects the user to their bank (data provider) with a signed authorization request (often using OAuth request object or PAR – pushed authorization request) to initiate login; the user authenticates with the bank (typically using multi-factor authentication as required by the bank’s policy), and the bank’s authorization server issues an authorization code that the third-party exchanges for tokens. **Mutual TLS (mTLS)** or **private\_key\_jwt** is used for client authentication to the token endpoint, per FAPI guidelines[dl.acm.org](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3699716#:~:text=Formal%20Security%20Analysis%20of%20the,TLS%20%28mTLS%29%20or%20private_key_jwt). FDX participants often use mTLS for secure channel and client identity, though private\_key\_jwt is an alternative – these mechanisms ensure only trusted, identified clients can communicate (in absence of a regulatory registry, FDX members establish trust via bilateral arrangements or through consortium frameworks like Akoya). FDX also supports **dynamic client registration** processes (with possible out-of-band vetting) to on-board TPPs to bank APIs, similar to other regimes’ directory services. Request signing: FDX recommends signing of critical API requests/responses (e.g., using JWS) for integrity, especially as it moves into two-way notifications and potentially high-sensitivity data. In summary, FDX’s security is **state-of-the-art OAuth2/OIDC**: it strongly aligns with the same FAPI profile used in OBIE and others, achieving high security comparable to regulated regimes[financialdataexchange.org](https://www.financialdataexchange.org/FDX/FDX/News/Announcements/FDX_Security_Specification_Boosted_with_FAPI.aspx#:~:text=FDX%27s%20Financial,0%20Advanced%20and%20CIBA%20protocols). The difference is that FDX’s use of these standards is voluntary and network-driven, rather than mandated by law – but it demonstrates industry consensus on using _OpenID Connect, JWTs, mTLS, and scope-based consent_ in the FDX ecosystem.
    
-   **UK OBIE (Security):** The OBIE security profile is based on OAuth 2.0 **with OpenID Connect** and the OIDF FAPI standard. In the UK, it was mandatory for CMA9 banks to implement according to the OBIE’s Security Profile, which was an instance of FAPI 1.0 Advanced (with UK-specific nuance like allowing both an “OAuth 2.0 hybrid flow” or authorization code + ID token approach). OBIE required **mutual TLS** for all connections between TPPs and banks, using digital certificates issued by the OBIE Directory[openbankingmap.com](https://www.openbankingmap.com/#:~:text=Driver%3ACompetition%20and%20Markets%20Authority%20,Use%20cases). (Originally, OBIE ran a central directory where TPPs and banks enrolled and obtained certificates for identification; post-Brexit, this continues as the UK has its own certificate regime rather than the EU’s eIDAS). OBIE also mandated **signing of requests**: for example, a payment initiation request must be signed by the TPP’s private key (so the bank can verify the integrity and origin) – this is part of the “non-repudiation” security measures built on JWS (JSON Web Signatures). The use of OIDC allowed banks to return an ID Token for the user (subject to user consent) to the TPP, but in practice many implementations focused on pure OAuth without needing user identity claims. **Client Authentication** at token endpoints in OBIE is via mTLS or private\_key\_jwt as per FAPI; OBIE directory certificates (OBWAC/OBSEAL) serve this role. Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) is a legal requirement: the user’s login at the bank must be two-factor (SCA) for any sensitive action, which covers the OAuth authorization step[fintechs-fairplay.medium.com](https://fintechs-fairplay.medium.com/open-banking-hits-20-adoption-after-six-years-heres-why-that-s-a-problem-5005f48e75b7#:~:text=The%20Adoption%20Reality)[fintechs-fairplay.medium.com](https://fintechs-fairplay.medium.com/open-banking-hits-20-adoption-after-six-years-heres-why-that-s-a-problem-5005f48e75b7#:~:text=March%20saw%2031%20million%20open,payments%20monthly%20through%20traditional%20channels). In summary, OBIE’s security is **very strict and standardized**: OAuth 2.0 + OIDC, FAPI profile (no plain implicit flows, only authorization code or hybrid with signed requests), mTLS between parties, and a trust framework via the OBIE Directory. This ensured a high level of security (reflected in no major security breaches reported in UK open banking) at the cost of significant complexity in onboarding and certificate handling.
    
-   **PSD2 (EU Security):** PSD2’s Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) on secure communication and SCA imposed a baseline: banks must use “strong customer authentication” for account access and must **identify TPPs** using digital certificates (the eIDAS **QWAC** and **QSeal** certificates)[pymnts.com](https://www.pymnts.com/bank-regulation/2024/australian-banking-association-open-banking-rules-need-new-pathway-forward/#:~:text=Bligh%20said%20this%20in%20a,their%20data%20between%20service%20providers)[pymnts.com](https://www.pymnts.com/bank-regulation/2024/australian-banking-association-open-banking-rules-need-new-pathway-forward/#:~:text=%CE%94). However, the RTS didn’t dictate OAuth or a specific protocol – it only said banks’ interfaces must be “secure and compliant.” In practice, the vast majority of European banks implemented OAuth 2.0 authorization flows similar to OBIE’s approach, many following the **Berlin Group’s OpenID-based framework**. A key difference in the EU is the _trust model_: instead of a central OBIE directory, TPPs present an eIDAS certificate issued by accredited Certificate Authorities. This certificate is used in TLS handshake (some banks require **mutual TLS with the QWAC** to establish the connection) and to sign requests (QSealC for signing payloads). Because eIDAS certificates uniformly identify the TPP (including roles like AIS or PIS provider), the OAuth token endpoint often accepts **TLS client cert auth** as the client credential – i.e., the certificate itself authenticates the client’s legitimacy[openbankingmap.com](https://www.openbankingmap.com/#:~:text=API%20Specs%3ARegulation%20only%20provides%20abstract,adopted%20specs%20have%20formed). Many EU APIs also support private\_key\_jwt client authentication using keys from the certificate. The **OAuth flows** are typically redirect-based (like OBIE): the user is redirected to the bank’s login page to approve consent and authenticate with MFA. Decoupled flows (using CIBA – a backchannel authentication where the bank app/device prompts the user) are also permitted by the standards and used especially in mobile banking contexts (OBIE and Berlin Group both adopted CIBA for decoupled SCA)[openid.net](https://openid.net/wordpress-content/uploads/2023/01/OIDF-Whitepaper_Open-Banking-and-Open-Data-Ready-to-Cross-Borders_Final.pdf#:~:text=Decoupled%20authorization%20flow%20CIBA%20CIBA,Authorization%20request%20delivery%20Signed%20request)[openid.net](https://openid.net/wordpress-content/uploads/2023/01/OIDF-Whitepaper_Open-Banking-and-Open-Data-Ready-to-Cross-Borders_Final.pdf#:~:text=flow%20CIBA%20CIBA%20N%20CIBA,Signed%20request%20object%20via%20front). The **scope of access** in tokens is usually tied to a consent resource (in Berlin Group’s case) or to what the user approved. Another nuance: because PSD2 is regulatory, some banks didn’t adopt full OIDC – i.e., they might not issue ID tokens or use an OpenID Provider approach except as needed for security. But the general trend, encouraged by the OpenID Foundation and others, was toward FAPI compliance across Europe as well[docs.secureauth.com](https://docs.secureauth.com/ciam/en/oauth,-consent,-and-api-security-for-financial-data-exchange--fdx-.html#:~:text=%28FDX%29%20docs,support%20of%20various%20authorization)[openid.net](https://openid.net/wordpress-content/uploads/2023/01/OIDF-Whitepaper_Open-Banking-and-Open-Data-Ready-to-Cross-Borders_Final.pdf#:~:text=%28FDX%29%20%28US%20and%20Canada%29,although%20some). Thus, OBIE and PSD2 security approaches are largely aligned (both are using FAPI-based OAuth2 with SCA). One additional requirement in PSD2: **fallback and contingency** – if a bank’s API is down, TPPs could (with some conditions) fall back to screen-scraping the user interface (RTS Article 33)[nvlpubs.nist.gov](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2022/NIST.IR.8389-draft.pdf#:~:text=488%20open%20finance%20ecosystem%20would,30)[nvlpubs.nist.gov](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2022/NIST.IR.8389-draft.pdf#:~:text=489%20framework%2C%20common%20standards%2C%20and,30), though in practice this is rare and the focus is on keeping APIs robust. Overall, **PSD2 security = OAuth 2.0 + eIDAS cert trust + SCA**, implemented with minor variations across banks but converging on high-security profiles.
    
-   **Australian CDR (Security):** The CDR standards also heavily borrow from the OpenID Foundation FAPI profile. Australian open banking uses an OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow with PKCE, and requires **mutual TLS** and/or signed JWT for client authentication in line with FAPI. A unique aspect is the presence of a government-run **CDR Directory (Register)** of accredited data recipients. Data recipients (Fintechs) must register with the authority and are issued digital certificates or software statements, which data holder (bank) APIs consume to trust the recipient. The technical flow often uses **dynamic client registration** with the Register: a data recipient can dynamically register with a bank’s authorization server by presenting a _software statement assertion_ (SSA) from the CDR Register, which contains its identity and permissions. This is akin to OBIE’s directory onboarding but in a regulated context. All communication between accredited parties and banks must use the registry-issued credentials and TLS. Customer authentication is via redirect to the bank (like OBIE), using whatever SCA the bank chooses (most Australian banks use OTPs or mobile app approval as 2FA). Additionally, Australia required compliant implementations to support the **Hybrid Flow with PAR** – i.e., TPPs first send a _PAR (Pushed Authorization Request)_ to the bank containing the details of requested consent; this returns a request URI that the TPP then uses in the redirect to the bank’s auth page[openid.net](https://openid.net/wordpress-content/uploads/2023/01/OIDF-Whitepaper_Open-Banking-and-Open-Data-Ready-to-Cross-Borders_Final.pdf#:~:text=delivery%20Signed%20request%20object%20via,channel%20Signed%20request%20object%20via)[openid.net](https://openid.net/wordpress-content/uploads/2023/01/OIDF-Whitepaper_Open-Banking-and-Open-Data-Ready-to-Cross-Borders_Final.pdf#:~:text=channel%20Signed%20request%20object%20via,Signed%20request%20object%20via%20PAR). This approach, part of FAPI 1.0 Advanced, ensures even large payloads or highly secure parameters are sent through a back-channel rather than via browser redirect. Like OBIE/PSD2, **request objects must be signed**, and ID tokens can be used. One difference: while UK/EU require SCA at least every 90 days for ongoing access (a PSD2 rule)[nvlpubs.nist.gov](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2022/NIST.IR.8389-draft.pdf#:~:text=488%20open%20finance%20ecosystem%20would,30), the Australian CDR rules require re-authorizations at most 12 months interval (and many consents are given shorter durations by default). Technically, refresh tokens in CDR have a 3 month absolute lifetime, so the user must re-authenticate at least every 3 months even if consent is active longer – this is a security measure to limit long-lived access. In summary, CDR’s security is **robust OAuth2 with a government-trusted party registry**. It ensures only accredited (licensed) apps can invoke APIs (similar to PSD2’s licensing+certificate regime), and every request is through secure channels and strongly authenticated. CDR, OBIE, and PSD2 all conform largely to the _Financial-Grade API (FAPI)_ profile, demonstrating global convergence on OAuth2 + OIDC for open banking security[docs.secureauth.com](https://docs.secureauth.com/ciam/en/oauth,-consent,-and-api-security-for-financial-data-exchange--fdx-.html#:~:text=OAuth%2C%20Consent%2C%20and%20API%20Security,support%20of%20various%20authorization).
    

## Consent and User Control Mechanisms

A cornerstone of all these frameworks is that **users (“customers”) are in control** of if and how their data is shared. Each system implements consent a bit differently in practice:

-   **FDX (Consent UX):** Since FDX operates in an industry-consensus environment rather than by law, it does not impose a single consent API or central consent registry. Instead, FDX provides guidelines and technical means to facilitate user consent. In an FDX data sharing flow, the _Data Recipient_ (third-party app) will trigger the bank’s OAuth authorization for specific data scopes (e.g., “read accounts”, “read transactions”) – those scopes and what they mean are defined in the FDX spec. FDX enumerates various **permission scopes** and corresponding data clusters, similar to other standards. It also explicitly includes “user experience guidelines” for how to present the data-sharing choice to users[mx.com](https://www.mx.com/blog/why-fdx-matters/#:~:text=includes%20three%20components%3A). For example, FDX’s 5 core principles include “User Control” and “Transparency”, so members commit to informing users which data will be shared and with whom[mx.com](https://www.mx.com/blog/why-fdx-matters/#:~:text=FDX%20is%20centered%20around%20five,sharing%20principles%20that%20empower%20users). Once the user authenticates and grants access at their bank (often selecting accounts to share if applicable), the bank issues tokens to the third party. **Consent records** – the bank keeps track of what the user approved (which accounts, what data, for how long). FDX doesn’t mandate a common format for these records externally, but it encourages providing **dashboards** to users. Many US banks that use FDX APIs have introduced _“authorized apps” dashboards_ in their online banking, where customers can view and revoke third-party connections[openbankingexpo.com](https://www.openbankingexpo.com/news/fdx-api-adoption-hits-114m-customer-connections/#:~:text=FDX%20noted%20that%20API%20adoption,may%20offer%20less%20customer%20control%E2%80%9D)[mx.com](https://www.mx.com/blog/why-fdx-matters/#:~:text=MX%20has%20always%20been%20an,and%20more%20reliable%20money%20experiences). Revocation in FDX is typically achieved by the user either instructing the third-party to disconnect (which leads the third-party to delete tokens) or by the user revoking access via the bank’s dashboard (which invalidates the tokens server-side). There isn’t a 90-day re-auth rule (that was specific to PSD2); FDX tokens/consents might last until revoked or until the bank’s policy requires renewal. Because it’s not legally required, consent duration and granularity in FDX implementations can vary by institution – but the FDX spec trending toward fine-grained scopes similar to OBIE/CDR. In summary, FDX supports **user-consented, scope-based access** and encourages transparency tools, but without a uniform regulatory mandate each institution may implement slightly different durations or interfaces (the spec harmonizes as much as possible by standardizing scopes and user flow recommendations).
    
-   **UK OBIE (Consent):** In OBIE’s model, _consent is explicit and granular_. When a TPP redirects a customer to a bank for authorization, it includes specific **“permissions” scopes** in the OAuth request (for example: `ReadAccountsDetail`, `ReadTransactionsDetail`, `ReadDirectDebits`, etc., or for payments: `MakePayments` with specific context)[openbanking.org.uk](https://www.openbanking.org.uk/news/category/impact-report/#:~:text=,Dedicated%20interfaces)[openbanking.org.uk](https://www.openbanking.org.uk/news/category/impact-report/#:~:text=,Change%20and%20communication%20management). The OBIE defined a standard set of permission strings that map to data clusters in the APIs. The bank’s authorization screen must display to the user exactly what data access is being requested – e.g., “App XYZ is requesting access to: your account balances, your transaction history (last 90 days), and your direct debits” – in a user-friendly way, following Customer Experience Guidelines[openbanking.org.uk](https://www.openbanking.org.uk/news/category/impact-report/#:~:text=,Directory%20sandbox). The user then consents (or denies). If they consent, the bank issues an access token tied to those permissions. Notably, in the UK, the **90-day re-authentication rule** (from PSD2) required that for ongoing account access, the user must be re-prompted to authenticate via the bank every 90 days[nvlpubs.nist.gov](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2022/NIST.IR.8389-draft.pdf#:~:text=488%20open%20finance%20ecosystem%20would,30). This was a regulatory requirement to ensure user consent is fresh. Many TPP apps managed this by alerting users when 90-day periods were expiring so they could re-authorize. Banks in UK must also provide the user a **consent dashboard** (usually in online banking or mobile app) listing all active consents (i.e., which TPPs have access to what data) and allowing the user to revoke any at will[mx.com](https://www.mx.com/blog/why-fdx-matters/#:~:text=MX%20has%20always%20been%20an,and%20more%20reliable%20money%20experiences)[mx.com](https://www.mx.com/blog/why-fdx-matters/#:~:text=Organizations%20like%20the%20Financial%20Data,permissioned%20data%20sharing). Revocation by the user or expiration means the TPP’s tokens are invalidated and access stops. OBIE’s framework also supports **consent withdrawal notifications** – TPPs get an error or notification if tokens expire or are revoked so they can inform the user. For payment initiation, consent is more transactional: the user approves a specific payment each time (or a series for recurring if using VRP/standing consent), so the concept of long-lived consent is mostly for data access (AIS). The OBIE approach to user control is therefore **fine-grained and mandated**: only data the user agreed to (for specific accounts and types) can be accessed, users see what they agreed, and they can revoke anytime via their bank or the TPP. These principles are enforced by regulation and standard in the UX design.
    
-   **PSD2 (EU Consent):** Similar to UK in concept, though implementation details differ by bank and standard. Under PSD2’s law, an AIS provider **must have the user’s explicit consent** to access account data (and must prove it to regulators on request), and the bank must only provide data that the user approved. In practice, this translated into banks requiring the user to select accounts and types of data in the authorization process. For example, when redirected for AIS consent, many banks show a list of the user’s accounts with checkboxes (“select which accounts to allow access to”) and descriptions of data (transactions, balances, etc.) being shared. The **Berlin Group API** formalized this via the concept of an “AIS consent object” that a TPP creates, specifying requested access (e.g. account numbers, and valid for 90 days, etc.)[openbankingmap.com](https://www.openbankingmap.com/#:~:text=,see%20more%20details%20here). The user sees this summarized during authentication and approves it. The bank then issues an access token or provides data based on that consent. Like UK, the **90-day reconfirmation** is required (an EU mandate): after 90 days of continuous access, the user must perform SCA again to renew access[nvlpubs.nist.gov](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2022/NIST.IR.8389-draft.pdf#:~:text=488%20open%20finance%20ecosystem%20would,30). Many banks implemented this by issuing short-lived tokens or by simply rejecting API calls after 90 days until the user reauthenticates. The scope strings in EU weren’t as standardized on the surface as OBIE’s (because each API standard defined their own). For instance, Berlin Group uses the concept of “supported account access scopes” communicated during consent initialization – not a simple string, but a JSON structure listing account IDs and data types. In effect, it’s similar to OBIE’s scopes but structured differently. For payment (PIS) in PSD2, the consent is transaction-specific (each payment requires an SCA and consent unless it’s a recurring transaction arrangement or a trusted beneficiary scenario). EU banks also must provide a way for customers to see and revoke consents: under PSD2, banks have to let users view which TPPs have accessed their data in the last 90 days and have the ability to revoke ongoing consents (for AIS, revocation simply stops further data flow)[nvlpubs.nist.gov](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2022/NIST.IR.8389-draft.pdf#:~:text=488%20open%20finance%20ecosystem%20would,30)[nvlpubs.nist.gov](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2022/NIST.IR.8389-draft.pdf#:~:text=489%20framework%2C%20common%20standards%2C%20and,30). This is often via the bank’s web portal (“Third-party access” settings). So, PSD2’s user control is **legally enforced** but slightly less standardized in UI compared to OBIE (which had centralized guidelines). Nonetheless, the common theme is the user is asked and must explicitly confirm data sharing, and they can cut it off whenever.
    
-   **Australian CDR (Consent):** The CDR approach to consent is one of the most rigorous and user-centric. Under CDR rules, consent must be **granular, time-bound, and specific**. When a consumer uses an accredited app to access their bank data, they go through a flow where they are shown exactly what data will be shared (down to specific categories like “your contact information, account balances, transactions from the last 12 months, etc.”) and for how long. Australian standards define “Consent flow” patterns and even **dashboard requirements**. Key features:
    
    -   The consumer must _actively select_ which accounts to share if multiple are available.
        
    -   Consent has a maximum duration of **12 months** by law[pymnts.com](https://www.pymnts.com/bank-regulation/2024/australian-banking-association-open-banking-rules-need-new-pathway-forward/#:~:text=Bligh%20said%20this%20in%20a,their%20data%20between%20service%20providers). Consumers can specify a shorter duration if they wish. Many consents default to 12 months and then need renewal.
        
    -   The consent must detail the frequency of access (e.g., one-time vs ongoing access for the period).
        
    -   Banks (Data Holders) must provide a **Consumer Dashboard** to every customer, showing all CDR consents the customer has given, with details (which third party, what data, when it expires)[pymnts.com](https://www.pymnts.com/bank-regulation/2024/australian-banking-association-open-banking-rules-need-new-pathway-forward/#:~:text=%CE%94). The customer can revoke any consent via this dashboard at any time, and the data holder’s next update to the third party will indicate the consent is withdrawn (or simply tokens expire).
        
    -   More than 50% of data sharing arrangements in 2023 were _not continued/renewed and lapsed_, highlighting that many consents are short-lived or one-time[pymnts.com](https://www.pymnts.com/bank-regulation/2024/australian-banking-association-open-banking-rules-need-new-pathway-forward/#:~:text=data%20between%20service%20providers). This reflects the strict expiration control in CDR.
        
    -   Another aspect is **fine-grained scope grouping**: The Data Standards enumerate specific _“data clusters”_ that map to consent checkboxes. For instance, “Account details”, “Transactions”, “Direct Debits”, “Payees” might each be a separate element the user can consent to. If an app only needs balance and transaction info, it shouldn’t request other clusters.
        
    
    The flow in CDR is thus very explicit. It can be somewhat longer UX than typical, because the user goes through multiple screens to acknowledge each aspect. But it ensures compliance with the principle that **customers know and control who sees their data**[openbankingmap.com](https://www.openbankingmap.com/#:~:text=Information%3A%20The%20Consumer%20Data%20Right,economy%2C%20including%20energy%20and%20telecommunications). Furthermore, only accredited and authenticated apps can even initiate this – so consumers are not asked to trust unknown parties. The CDR emphasizes that consumers “are in the driver’s seat,” similar in spirit to FDX’s principles[mx.com](https://www.mx.com/blog/why-fdx-matters/#:~:text=the%20financial%20industry%20can%20contribute,FDX%20API%20and%20other%20objectives) but backed by law. Revocation and expiration are systematically enforced (which, as noted, has led to low sustained use – a criticism is that the process is so cautious it creates friction, contributing to lower uptake[pymnts.com](https://www.pymnts.com/bank-regulation/2024/australian-banking-association-open-banking-rules-need-new-pathway-forward/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CDespite%20the%20best%20efforts%20of,CDR%20has%20been%20comparatively%20low)[fintechs-fairplay.medium.com](https://fintechs-fairplay.medium.com/open-banking-hits-20-adoption-after-six-years-heres-why-that-s-a-problem-5005f48e75b7#:~:text=The%20report%20notes%20that%20consumer,technology%E2%80%99s%20limitations%20than%20its%20potential)). Nonetheless, from a privacy standpoint, CDR likely gives the most control to the consumer out of these frameworks.
    

In summary, **all frameworks require consumer consent and allow revocation**, but:

-   _FDX_: Industry best-practice, not mandated – focuses on building trust and providing tools for user control, relies on participants to implement dashboards.
    
-   _OBIE/PSD2_: Mandatory explicit consent per use-case, standardized or regulated UX, with periodic re-auth (90 days) and mandatory revocation ability via banks.
    
-   _CDR_: Very explicit, regulated consent process, with fixed maximum duration and robust consumer dashboards, arguably the most stringent in ensuring user control.
    

## Market Adoption and Ecosystem Maturity

All four initiatives are at different stages of maturity and have varying degrees of adoption in the market:

-   **FDX Adoption (North America):** The FDX API has seen _rapid industry uptake in the U.S._ as the market shifts away from credential-based data aggregation (screen scraping) to API-based data sharing. As of April 2025, FDX reported **114 million consumer data connections** using the FDX API in the U.S. and Canada[openbankingexpo.com](https://www.openbankingexpo.com/news/fdx-api-adoption-hits-114m-customer-connections/#:~:text=Financial%20Data%20Exchange%20,data%20sharing%20continues%20to%20grow)[openbankingexpo.com](https://www.openbankingexpo.com/news/fdx-api-adoption-hits-114m-customer-connections/#:~:text=In%20a%20press%20statement%2C%20the,%E2%80%9Cimprove%20interoperability%20when%20they%20integrate%E2%80%9D). This was a 50% increase from the 76 million a year prior[openbankingexpo.com](https://www.openbankingexpo.com/news/fdx-api-adoption-hits-114m-customer-connections/#:~:text=continues%20to%20grow). These figures indicate that a large portion of consumers who link bank accounts to fintech apps (for budgeting, payments, etc.) are now using API connections underpinned by the FDX standard. Major U.S. banks (e.g., Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, etc.) and major aggregators/fintechs (Plaid, Intuit, Envestnet Yodlee, MX, Finicity, etc.) are among the ~200 members of FDX and have been implementing the API[openbankingexpo.com](https://www.openbankingexpo.com/news/fdx-api-adoption-hits-114m-customer-connections/#:~:text=In%20a%20press%20statement%2C%20the,%E2%80%9Cimprove%20interoperability%20when%20they%20integrate%E2%80%9D)[openbankingexpo.com](https://www.openbankingexpo.com/news/fdx-api-adoption-hits-114m-customer-connections/#:~:text=FDX%20is%20a%20standard,more%20than%20200%20member%20organisations). The growth has been industry-driven, but it’s **significant**: by 2025, FDX data sharing is effectively mainstream in North America’s fintech ecosystem, though not _universal_ yet (tens of millions of users still use credential-based methods where APIs are not available[openbankingexpo.com](https://www.openbankingexpo.com/news/fdx-api-adoption-hits-114m-customer-connections/#:~:text=FDX%20noted%20that%20API%20adoption,may%20offer%20less%20customer%20control%E2%80%9D)). The U.S. government’s backing (CFPB’s endorsement of FDX) suggests adoption will only increase as formal regulations likely mandate open banking in coming years. So, FDX’s ecosystem is _mature in terms of numbers_ – hundreds of millions of API calls and over a hundred million accounts – but still _in development in terms of coverage_, since it covers many large institutions but smaller community banks or credit unions might not yet be on board until regulation nudges them. FDX does not have a concept of “licensed TPP” like PSD2; any app can potentially use an FDX API if the bank and aggregator make it available. This means the ecosystem grew organically where the value was seen (e.g., large banks actively partnering with aggregators).
    
-   **UK OBIE Adoption:** The UK is often cited as a success case in open banking rollout. By early 2025, the number of **active open banking users in the UK reached around 13.3 million (about 20% of the eligible population)**[fintechs-fairplay.medium.com](https://fintechs-fairplay.medium.com/open-banking-hits-20-adoption-after-six-years-heres-why-that-s-a-problem-5005f48e75b7#:~:text=The%20Adoption%20Reality). This includes both consumers and small businesses. Growth has been accelerating – e.g., 5.8 million in early 2022 to over 13 million by 2025[fintechs-fairplay.medium.com](https://fintechs-fairplay.medium.com/open-banking-hits-20-adoption-after-six-years-heres-why-that-s-a-problem-5005f48e75b7#:~:text=The%20Adoption%20Reality), and about **one in five** UK adults or businesses now regularly use an open banking service. Additionally, open banking API usage is very high: the UK saw over **1 billion API calls per month by 2022**[kontomatik.com](https://www.kontomatik.com/blog/open-banking-statistics-across-europe#:~:text=UK%E2%80%99s%20API%20calls%20increased%20to,per%20month%20in%20four%20years) (up from virtually zero in 2018). The OBIE regularly publishes an Impact Report highlighting statistics like the number of TPPs (there are over 240 regulated TPPs in the UK by 2023) and use cases. One standout area is **open banking payments** – in March 2023, there were 31 million open banking facilitated payments (account-to-account payments) in that month in the UK[fintechs-fairplay.medium.com](https://fintechs-fairplay.medium.com/open-banking-hits-20-adoption-after-six-years-heres-why-that-s-a-problem-5005f48e75b7#:~:text=March%20saw%2031%20million%20open,payments%20monthly%20through%20traditional%20channels). This is a small fraction (~1%) of total retail payments volume, but it’s growing rapidly. The UK ecosystem has a rich array of fintech apps offering personal finance management, credit affordability checks, and alternative payment options using OBIE APIs. All major banks and many smaller ones expose the standard APIs; performance and uptime are closely monitored and reported by OBIE’s transparency tools[openbanking.org.uk](https://www.openbanking.org.uk/news/category/impact-report/#:~:text=,Login)[openbanking.org.uk](https://www.openbanking.org.uk/news/category/impact-report/#:~:text=Documentation%20,Directory%20specifications). The UK’s ecosystem is **one of the most mature globally**, with strong government support and a relatively high consumer awareness (though 20% adoption means 80% have yet to use it, indicating room to grow)[fintechs-fairplay.medium.com](https://fintechs-fairplay.medium.com/open-banking-hits-20-adoption-after-six-years-heres-why-that-s-a-problem-5005f48e75b7#:~:text=Open%20Banking%20Limited%20reports%2013,to%20one%20in%20five%20today)[fintechs-fairplay.medium.com](https://fintechs-fairplay.medium.com/open-banking-hits-20-adoption-after-six-years-heres-why-that-s-a-problem-5005f48e75b7#:~:text=level%20as%20small%20businesses,technology%E2%80%99s%20limitations%20than%20its%20potential). The success is tempered by critical voices noting that, while adoption in percentage terms lags initial grand visions, it’s still ahead of most other regions due to the early start and comprehensive standard[fintechs-fairplay.medium.com](https://fintechs-fairplay.medium.com/open-banking-hits-20-adoption-after-six-years-heres-why-that-s-a-problem-5005f48e75b7#:~:text=One%20in%20five%20UK%20consumers,Banking%20Limited%E2%80%99s%20latest%20impact%20report)[fintechs-fairplay.medium.com](https://fintechs-fairplay.medium.com/open-banking-hits-20-adoption-after-six-years-heres-why-that-s-a-problem-5005f48e75b7#:~:text=The%20Adoption%20Reality).
    
-   **PSD2 (EU) Adoption:** Across Europe, open banking is now an established reality, but adoption rates vary per country. A recent report estimated roughly **64 million open banking users in Europe by 2024**, roughly ~25% of the European online population[kontomatik.com](https://www.kontomatik.com/blog/open-banking-statistics-across-europe#:~:text=European%20users%20expected%20to%20reach,8%20million%20in%202024). This number includes the UK in some counts, or excludes it in others, but generally Europe (including UK) has tens of millions of users. Some countries (like Sweden, Norway, Denmark) have very high penetration, boosted by things like BankID digital identity usage for smooth login[nvlpubs.nist.gov](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2022/NIST.IR.8389-draft.pdf#:~:text=462%20banking,API%20Access%20Scheme%20to). Others lag. There are over **500 licensed TPPs** across the EEA by 2023[kontomatik.com](https://www.kontomatik.com/blog/open-banking-statistics-across-europe#:~:text=Over%20300%20TPPs%20received%20approval,services%20between%202019%20and%202022), and even more if you count multiple registrations (some large banks also act as TPPs to aggregate data). The API performance has improved over time: early years (2019–2020) were plagued by inconsistent quality and downtime at some banks, but by 2021–2022, many of those issues were resolved or mitigated. Nonetheless, the fragmentation (different API standards) means integration for a TPP across all of Europe is complex – often requiring connections to multiple API aggregators or adapting to multiple standards. The result has been that _use cases that truly span Europe are fewer_, while domestic usage in each country, leveraging that country’s predominant standard, is more common. According to some metrics, less than 30% of European banks were fully compliant by the initial 2019 deadline, and only in subsequent years did compliance near 100%[proofid.com](https://proofid.com/blog/lessons-learned-from-open-banking-in-the-uk-europe-insights-for-the-us/#:~:text=Lessons%20learned%20from%20Open%20Banking,Focus). However, by now essentially all relevant banks have an API, and screen-scraping is largely phased out or kept as a fallback. Market adoption in EU also depends on what services are offered – many TPPs provide multi-bank account aggregation, and some provide payment initiation (especially in e-commerce checkout for instant bank payments). The volume of **API calls** in Europe (excluding UK) is significant but not as openly tracked as in the UK; it’s estimated Europe accounts for about 46% of global open banking API products and usage[kontomatik.com](https://www.kontomatik.com/blog/open-banking-statistics-across-europe#:~:text=Europe%20accounts%20for%2046,global%20API%20product%20offerings). The ecosystem is growing – Forrester predicts a doubling of adoption by 2027 in Europe[kontomatik.com](https://www.kontomatik.com/blog/open-banking-statistics-across-europe#:~:text=Experts%20say%20adoption%20of%20open,services%20will%20double%20by%202027). In summary, PSD2 succeeded in creating a _universal baseline_ – thousands of banks with APIs and hundreds of TPPs – but the depth of usage is uneven. Some markets like the Nordics or Netherlands see high usage (helped by tech-savvy users and supportive banks), while others are slower. Still, Europe collectively has a larger absolute number of users than any other region (tens of millions), though per-country percentages vary.
    
-   **Australian CDR Adoption:** Australia’s open banking journey has had _slower consumer uptake_ despite solid infrastructure. By the end of 2023, only **0.31% of Australian bank customers were actively using CDR data sharing**[pymnts.com](https://www.pymnts.com/bank-regulation/2024/australian-banking-association-open-banking-rules-need-new-pathway-forward/#:~:text=%CE%94). That’s only a few hundred-thousand individuals (one report noted ~197,000 active data sharing arrangements as of early 2024)[fst.net.au](https://fst.net.au/financial-services-news/four-years-in-cdr-uptake-remains-disappointingly-low/#:~:text=Four%20years%20in%2C%20CDR%20uptake,of%20these). This low uptake – under 1% after 3+ years – has been a point of concern, leading the Australian Banking Association to call for a re-evaluation of the regime[pymnts.com](https://www.pymnts.com/bank-regulation/2024/australian-banking-association-open-banking-rules-need-new-pathway-forward/#:~:text=Australian%20Banking%20Association%20,the%20country%E2%80%99s%20open%20banking%20rules)[pymnts.com](https://www.pymnts.com/bank-regulation/2024/australian-banking-association-open-banking-rules-need-new-pathway-forward/#:~:text=Bligh%20said%20this%20in%20a,their%20data%20between%20service%20providers). There are about 100+ accredited data recipients (as of 2023) and all banks (100+ data holders) are technically capable of sharing data[content.frollo.com.au](https://content.frollo.com.au/Marketing_Content/The+State+of+Open+Banking+2024.pdf#:~:text=,data%20with%20accredited%20third%20parties). The ecosystem functionality is in place, but consumer-facing services have been limited. Many large banks themselves became accredited to use the data (for example, for lending decisions), and fintech innovation has been slower than hoped due to burdensome accreditation costs and the read-only limitation. However, there’s recent momentum: by 2024, ~66% of the accredited parties were active data recipients (meaning more fintechs are building offerings), and the government has been adjusting rules to encourage participation[thefintechtimes.com](https://thefintechtimes.com/fintech-australia-provides-update-on-cdr-service-rollout/#:~:text=FinTech%20Australia%20Provides%20Update%20on,cent%20of%20the%20ecosystem%2C). Also, the expansion of CDR to energy and telco might spur cross-sector apps that attract users. It’s a classic case of “build it and they will (hopefully) come” – the framework is robust, but mass consumer adoption needs time or further incentives. By comparison, the UK hit ~4 million users (about 6% of population) in the same timeframe that Australia hit 0.3%[blog.international.jtglobal.com](https://blog.international.jtglobal.com/age-verification-is-a-critical-tool-in-safeguarding-the-young-and-preventing-fraud-0#:~:text=The%20current%20status%20of%20PSD2,users%20across%20the%20UK%2C), partly because the UK had immediate use cases like budgeting apps that were easy to adopt, whereas Australia’s consumer awareness and availability of compelling apps have lagged. The **maturity of the Australian system technically** is strong (banks delivered good APIs, largely consistent due to one standard), but **maturity of usage** is still in early stages. This has prompted strategic reviews and calls for changes (possibly simplifying consent or broadening functionality) to drive adoption[pymnts.com](https://www.pymnts.com/bank-regulation/2024/australian-banking-association-open-banking-rules-need-new-pathway-forward/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CDespite%20the%20best%20efforts%20of,CDR%20has%20been%20comparatively%20low)[pymnts.com](https://www.pymnts.com/bank-regulation/2024/australian-banking-association-open-banking-rules-need-new-pathway-forward/#:~:text=The%20review%20found%20that%20the,four%20years%20after%20their%20launch).
    

In summary, **UK and EU are leading in user numbers and active ecosystem**, North America (FDX) is catching up quickly via industry-driven adoption (particularly as it covers a large market with many financial apps – 114 million connections is significant, though not directly comparable to “users”: some users have multiple accounts connected)[openbankingexpo.com](https://www.openbankingexpo.com/news/fdx-api-adoption-hits-114m-customer-connections/#:~:text=Financial%20Data%20Exchange%20,data%20sharing%20continues%20to%20grow). Australia demonstrates that even with a comprehensive framework, _adoption isn’t automatic_ – it requires compelling use cases and perhaps easier processes for consumers. FDX’s growth highlights that when the industry cooperates (even without a law), it can migrate a huge base of users to APIs, given the demand for data sharing is already present in the market (e.g., millions were already connecting accounts via screen-scraping, and they’ve been steadily transitioned to APIs)[openbankingexpo.com](https://www.openbankingexpo.com/news/fdx-api-adoption-hits-114m-customer-connections/#:~:text=FDX%20noted%20that%20API%20adoption,may%20offer%20less%20customer%20control%E2%80%9D). The trajectory for all regions is upward, but the pace and form differ.

## Interoperability and Alignment with International Efforts

With multiple standards around the world, there is an active dialogue on converging and aligning open banking/open finance frameworks:

-   **Security Alignment:** Perhaps the biggest area of convergence is in security protocols. All the major open banking regimes (OBIE, PSD2, CDR, many others like Brazil, etc.) have aligned around the **OpenID Foundation’s FAPI** as the recommended profile for OAuth2/OIDC[docs.secureauth.com](https://docs.secureauth.com/ciam/en/oauth,-consent,-and-api-security-for-financial-data-exchange--fdx-.html#:~:text=%28FDX%29%20docs,support%20of%20various%20authorization). This means that theoretically, a single fintech app’s OAuth client could be used in multiple jurisdictions with minimal changes (aside from different certificates/registrations) because the flows (PAR, PKCE, mTLS, etc.) are similar. FDX’s adoption of FAPI brings North America into alignment with this global best practice[globenewswire.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/12/21/2800371/0/en/Financial-Data-Exchange-FDX-Announces-Release-of-FDX-API-v6-0-featuring-Revolutionary-Updates-for-Open-Finance-Data-Sharing.html#:~:text=version%20of%20the%20API%20includes,of%20the%20FAPI%20security%20schema). The FAPI standard ensures high security and **interoperability at the protocol level** – indeed, a number of vendors now offer FAPI-compliant authorization servers that can be configured for OBIE, Berlin Group, FDX, etc. with tweaks[cloudentity.com](https://cloudentity.com/developers/get-started/platform/whats-new/#:~:text=What%27s%20New%20in%20Cloudentity%2008,value). So on security, we see international standardization: OAuth 2.0 + OIDC, PKCE, mTLS/private\_key\_jwt, JWS request signing, and standards like **DCR (Dynamic Client Registration)** and **JARM (JWT-secured Authorization Response Mode)** are commonly used across these frameworks.
    
-   **Data Model and API Alignment:** This is more challenging, but there are efforts. OBIE and Berlin Group have already shared learnings; their data models for accounts and transactions overlap significantly[openid.net](https://openid.net/wordpress-content/uploads/2023/01/OIDF-Whitepaper_Open-Banking-and-Open-Data-Ready-to-Cross-Borders_Final.pdf#:~:text=,although%20some). Both were influenced by ISO20022. FDX, being originally from a different lineage (Durable Data API/OFX), had some different structures, but FDX has shown awareness of global terminology. For example, FDX includes international payment network data and even IBAN fields to cater to cross-border accounts[globenewswire.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/12/21/2800371/0/en/Financial-Data-Exchange-FDX-Announces-Release-of-FDX-API-v6-0-featuring-Revolutionary-Updates-for-Open-Finance-Data-Sharing.html#:~:text=RESTON%2C%20Va,of%20the%20FAPI%20security%20schema)[globenewswire.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/12/21/2800371/0/en/Financial-Data-Exchange-FDX-Announces-Release-of-FDX-API-v6-0-featuring-Revolutionary-Updates-for-Open-Finance-Data-Sharing.html#:~:text=version%20of%20the%20API%20includes,of%20the%20FAPI%20security%20schema), and it is expanding to things like payroll which are not in other banking standards (leading rather than aligning in those areas). The **Bank for International Settlements (BIS)** and other global bodies have called for harmonization of API standards where possible[bis.org](https://www.bis.org/cpmi/publ/d224.pdf#:~:text=,certain%20markets%2C%20differences%20in%20clearing)[bis.org](https://www.bis.org/cpmi/publ/d224.pdf#:~:text=data%20model%20and%20have%20been,certain%20markets%2C%20differences%20in%20clearing). The EU’s proposed _FIDA (Financial Data Access)_ framework is looking to create a more unified scheme in Europe (potentially learning from OBIE’s singular approach)[openbankingmap.com](https://www.openbankingmap.com/#:~:text=%2A%202021,published)[openbankingmap.com](https://www.openbankingmap.com/#:~:text=%2A%202023,published). Meanwhile, countries like **Canada** are explicitly trying to align with others: Canada’s advisory report suggested using the FDX API as a baseline, given the U.S. likely will, but also learning from OBIE and CDR[openbankingmap.com](https://www.openbankingmap.com/#:~:text=Framework%3AOpen%20Baning%20in%20Canada%20Driver%3AGovernment,Type%3ARegulation%20Banks%3ABanks%20implementing%20OpenBanking%20Timeline)[openbankingmap.com](https://www.openbankingmap.com/#:~:text=release%20www,04%3A%20Implementation%20Deadline%202). The Open Banking Implementation in Canada is working with the **Digital Governance Standards Institute** and liaising with FDX to ensure cross-border consistency, since many banks operate in both US and Canada[openbankingmap.com](https://www.openbankingmap.com/#:~:text=Open%20Banking%20in%20Canada)[openbankingmap.com](https://www.openbankingmap.com/#:~:text=Shift%20to%20Open%20Banking%20www,Deadline%201%2C%20for%20largest%20institutions).
    
-   **Consent and Customer Experience:** International groups like the **Global Financial Innovation Network (GFIN)** and bilateral dialogues (UK-Australia FinTech Bridge, etc.) have shared best practices on consent UX. We see similar patterns – e.g., the UK’s OBIE customer experience guidelines influenced the Australian Data Standards for consent screens. There’s broad agreement on principles like “in plain language, tell the customer what data they’re sharing and for how long” and “provide dashboards for control” – these are consistent across OBIE, CDR, and even FDX’s principles[mx.com](https://www.mx.com/blog/why-fdx-matters/#:~:text=the%20financial%20industry%20can%20contribute,FDX%20API%20and%20other%20objectives)[openbankingmap.com](https://www.openbankingmap.com/#:~:text=Information%3A%20The%20Consumer%20Data%20Right,economy%2C%20including%20energy%20and%20telecommunications). So while not identical, a user who has seen one open banking consent screen will find others familiar in concept.
    
-   **Interoperability Initiatives:** Some private companies and open-source initiatives aim to act as _bridges_ or unified APIs. For instance, **Plaid** and other aggregators provide a single API to fintech apps and under the hood connect to OBIE APIs in the UK, Berlin Group APIs in the EU, FDX in the US, etc., performing the translation. This is a market solution to interoperability. On the standards level, bodies like the **OpenID Foundation** (with FAPI) and **ISO** (which published ISO 23029:2020, a technical spec for open banking APIs) are attempting to standardize pieces of the puzzle[scc-ccn.ca](https://scc-ccn.ca/system/files/2024-05/scc_data_gov_roadmap_en.pdf#:~:text=,open%20banking%20standards%2C%20in). ISO 23029, for example, might push more harmonization in data structures over time.
    
-   **Overlaps:** There are notable overlaps already:
    
    -   OBIE and PSD2 data scope overlaps on accounts/payments; OBIE essentially implemented PSD2 plus extra U.K. specific requirements (like the CMA order’s product scope included some small business accounts and future considerations for open finance)[nvlpubs.nist.gov](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2022/NIST.IR.8389-draft.pdf#:~:text=478%20a%20push%20toward%20a,see%20the%20relevance%20of%20the)[nvlpubs.nist.gov](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2022/NIST.IR.8389-draft.pdf#:~:text=PSD2%20boundary%20484%20,to%20open%20banking%2C%20a%20broader).
        
    -   CDR and FDX both embrace **open finance** beyond banking, showing a likely convergence of direction (open banking evolving into open finance globally). In a few years, many expect that standards will extend to cover investments, insurance, etc. – FDX already covers those in its spec, CDR has the legal framework to extend (and will cover more sectors), the UK is exploring Open Finance in the next phase[nvlpubs.nist.gov](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2022/NIST.IR.8389-draft.pdf#:~:text=479%20for%20the%20sharing%20of,relevance%20of%20the%20PSD2%20boundary)[nvlpubs.nist.gov](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2022/NIST.IR.8389-draft.pdf#:~:text=,as%20a%20legislative%20and%20regulatory), and the EU’s FIDA proposal is essentially Open Finance at an EU-wide level[openbankingmap.com](https://www.openbankingmap.com/#:~:text=%2A%202021,published)[openbankingmap.com](https://www.openbankingmap.com/#:~:text=%2A%202023,published).
        
    -   There’s alignment in **terminology**: concepts like AIS (Account Information Service) and PIS (Payment Initiation Service) from PSD2 are now common language in open banking discussions worldwide, even if regulatory environments differ. The U.S. CFPB’s forthcoming rule references “personal financial data rights” but is essentially about enabling an equivalent of AIS in the US[openbankingmap.com](https://www.openbankingmap.com/#:~:text=%2A%202010,encouraged%20to%20act%20on)[openbankingmap.com](https://www.openbankingmap.com/#:~:text=%2A%202023,590%20pages). So frameworks are converging on a common set of services and likely will use similar API calls for them.
        
-   **Remaining Divergences:** Despite alignment efforts, true plug-and-play interoperability isn’t here yet. A fintech from one region expanding to another often has to do custom work. For example, a UK fintech entering the Australian market must integrate with the CDR ecosystem (obtaining accreditation, etc.) – it can’t reuse its OBIE integration wholesale. Similarly, a U.S. company wanting to access EU bank data must become a PSD2-licensed TPP and adapt to those API specs or use an intermediary. Over time, if global standards initiatives progress (perhaps a future “Global Open Finance API Standard”), we might see closer alignment. For now, **each regime is distinct but learning from the others**. The good news is that the foundational building blocks (OAuth2, JSON, REST, etc.) are common, so it’s more about mapping differences than completely unrelated systems.
    

The table below summarizes key similarities and differences across FDX 6.1, UK OBIE, EU PSD2, and Australian CDR:

Strong enforceability (non-compliant banks face penalties). However, multiple standard flavors allowed, so not uniform across countries[nvlpubs.nist.gov](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2022/NIST.IR.8389-draft.pdf#:~:text=456%20the%20EU,24%5D.%20Nonetheless%2C%20the)[nvlpubs.nist.gov](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2022/NIST.IR.8389-draft.pdf#:~:text=458%20Although%20approximately%2078%20,Index%202021%20has%20recently%20ranked). | Australia.

| **API Design (RESTfulness, etc.)** | Modern RESTful API with JSON payloads (successor to legacy OFX XML)[nvlpubs.nist.gov](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2022/NIST.IR.8389-draft.pdf#:~:text=720%20working%20group%20,has%20stated%20that%20existing%20versions).

Focus on interoperability and performance (e.g., bulk data, two-way notifications added in v6.0)[globenewswire.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/12/21/2800371/0/en/Financial-Data-Exchange-FDX-Announces-Release-of-FDX-API-v6-0-featuring-Revolutionary-Updates-for-Open-Finance-Data-Sharing.html#:~:text=Here%20are%20a%20few%20new,0). | RESTful JSON APIs (HTTP/1.1). Endpoints organized by resource: e.g., `/accounts`, `/accounts/{id}/transactions`, `/payments`[openbankingmap.com](https://www.openbankingmap.com/#:~:text=API%20Specs%3AOpen%20API%20files%2C%20usage,Use%20cases). Standard OpenAPI definitions provided by OBIE. Version ~3.1.x (mature, incremental changes). Includes webhooks/event notifications for AIS (though not universally used). Very uniform across UK banks. | RESTful JSON APIs in practice (though PSD2 didn’t dictate REST, it became the norm). Berlin Group and others define similar endpoints to OBIE (with slight naming differences). Consent endpoints exist in many specs (e.g., `POST /consents`). Versions vary (Berlin Group ~v1.3, STET etc.). Some fragmentation in design (different URL structures per standard). Overall REST/JSON is standard across EU implementations[nvlpubs.nist.gov](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2022/NIST.IR.8389-draft.pdf#:~:text=456%20the%20EU,24%5D.%20Nonetheless%2C%20the). | RESTful JSON API. Endpoints defined by Consumer Data Standards (available via public GitHub). Structure similar to OBIE (e.g., `/banking/accounts`, `/banking/transactions`). Versioned standards, updated as scope expands. Currently read-only (no payment initiation yet)[openbankingmap.com](https://www.openbankingmap.com/#:~:text=Use%20cases%3A). Consistent design mandated for all banks, aiding uniformity. |
| **Data Model & Scope of Data** | **Open Finance scope**: covers banking accounts (checking, savings, credit card), plus investments, mortgages, loans, insurance, tax documents, **payroll data** (VOE/VOI), etc.[globenewswire.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/12/21/2800371/0/en/Financial-Data-Exchange-FDX-Announces-Release-of-FDX-API-v6-0-featuring-Revolutionary-Updates-for-Open-Finance-Data-Sharing.html#:~:text=RESTON%2C%20Va,of%20the%20FAPI%20security%20schema)[globenewswire.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/12/21/2800371/0/en/Financial-Data-Exchange-FDX-Announces-Release-of-FDX-API-v6-0-featuring-Revolutionary-Updates-for-Open-Finance-Data-Sharing.html#:~:text=financial%20institution%20%28NFI%29.%20,VOI%29%20information). Data model originally based on Durable Data API, now 600+ data elements[mx.com](https://www.mx.com/blog/why-fdx-matters/#:~:text=FDX%E2%80%99s%20open%20finance%20standards%20provide,FDX%20API%20includes%20three%20components). Uses JSON schema (proprietary but aligning with industry needs). U.S.-centric fields (ACH routing, US tax forms) but includes international fields where needed. No inherent limitation to “payment accounts” – goal is all consumer financial data[mx.com](https://www.mx.com/blog/why-fdx-matters/#:~:text=Open%20Finance%20%20enables%20access,solutions%20to%20improve%20financial%20wellness). | **Open Banking (narrower)**: limited to payment-related accounts by mandate. OBIE v3 covered personal & business current accounts; later extended to credit cards, some loans, e-wallets[openbanking.org.uk](https://www.openbanking.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Open-Banking-September-Infographic.pdf#:~:text=,in%20all%20currencies%20and). Data objects: Account (with identifiers like IBAN or sort code/acct #, currency, etc.), Transaction (amount, date, description, merchant, category), Balance, Beneficiary, DirectDebit, StandingOrder, ScheduledPayment, etc. Model aligns with ISO 20022 terminology and UK specifics. Does _not_ include non-banking financial products (those are being looked at for Open Finance, but not in the OBIE standard yet)[nvlpubs.nist.gov](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2022/NIST.IR.8389-draft.pdf#:~:text=478%20a%20push%20toward%20a,see%20the%20relevance%20of%20the). | **Open Banking (payments focus)**: PSD2 legally covers “payment accounts” (checking, payment-enabled accounts, credit cards). So data model in Berlin/STET specs centers on accounts, balances, transactions, and payees, plus payments initiation. Other products (investments, mortgages) are outside PSD2’s scope[nvlpubs.nist.gov](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2022/NIST.IR.8389-draft.pdf#:~:text=469%204,data%20access%20to%20a%20broader). Data schemas based on ISO 20022 where available[openid.net](https://openid.net/wordpress-content/uploads/2023/01/OIDF-Whitepaper_Open-Banking-and-Open-Data-Ready-to-Cross-Borders_Final.pdf#:~:text=,although%20some). Some country-specific data (e.g., German bank account IDs vs. IBAN). Lacks “open finance” data beyond payments, although some banks add extra data voluntarily. | **Open Data across sectors**: In banking, covers a broad set of retail and business accounts: savings, term deposits, checking, credit cards, mortgages, loans, overdrafts, etc.[openbankingmap.com](https://www.openbankingmap.com/#:~:text=,Other%20industries%20to%20follow). Also includes “product reference data” (bank product information like interest rates, fees) to allow product comparison[openbankingmap.com](https://www.openbankingmap.com/#:~:text=Timeline%3A%20Detailed%20infographics%20on%20the,including%20types%20of%20data%20shared). Schema is JSON, inspired by OBIE but adapted to AUS context (e.g., BSB number for routing). Beyond banking, CDR schema extends to energy usage data, telco plans, etc., but those are separate APIs. Within banking, essentially an **open finance breadth** (minus investments/insurance so far). |
| **Security & Authentication** | **OAuth 2.0 + OIDC (FAPI profile)**. FDX recommends OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow with PKCE, and has adopted **Financial-grade API (FAPI 1.0 Advanced)** security[financialdataexchange.org](https://www.financialdataexchange.org/FDX/FDX/News/Announcements/FDX_Security_Specification_Boosted_with_FAPI.aspx#:~:text=FDX%27s%20Financial,0%20Advanced%20and%20CIBA%20protocols). Supports **mutual TLS** and/or `private_key_jwt` for client auth[dl.acm.org](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3699716#:~:text=Formal%20Security%20Analysis%20of%20the,TLS%20%28mTLS%29%20or%20private_key_jwt). Uses JWTs for request objects and token claims, aligning with OpenID Connect. No centralized trust framework imposed (each data provider and recipient establish trust, often via membership or bilateral agreements, or networks like Akoya). Strong push for eliminating credential sharing – user always authenticates at their bank’s domain (OAuth redirect)[openbankingexpo.com](https://www.openbankingexpo.com/news/fdx-api-adoption-hits-114m-customer-connections/#:~:text=FDX%20noted%20that%20API%20adoption,may%20offer%20less%20customer%20control%E2%80%9D). FDX Security 3.4+ references CIBA for decoupled flows (out-of-band auth)[financialdataexchange.org](https://www.financialdataexchange.org/FDX/FDX/News/Announcements/FDX_Security_Specification_Boosted_with_FAPI.aspx#:~:text=FDX%27s%20Financial,0%20Advanced%20and%20CIBA%20protocols). Overall, security is on par with regulated regimes (FAPI-compliant). | **OAuth 2.0 + OpenID (FAPI)**. OBIE required banks to implement the Open Banking Security Profile: essentially OAuth 2.0 with PKCE + mutual TLS, using OBIE directory-issued certs for client authentication[openbankingmap.com](https://www.openbankingmap.com/#:~:text=Driver%3ACompetition%20and%20Markets%20Authority%20,Use%20cases). OpenID Connect is used (ID token can be returned). **FAPI 1.0 Advanced** is the baseline (signed request objects, PAR, etc.). Mandatory **SCA** for user login (UK implemented PSD2’s 90-day re-auth rule)[nvlpubs.nist.gov](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2022/NIST.IR.8389-draft.pdf#:~:text=488%20open%20finance%20ecosystem%20would,30). OBIE also mandated **JWS signing of requests** (e.g., payments requests signed by TPP’s key) for integrity. Trust is centralized: OBIE Directory verified TPPs and issued digital certificates, creating a **whitelist** of participants. Overall very high security and standardized certification of participants. | **OAuth 2.0 + eIDAS certificates**. Nearly all PSD2 APIs use OAuth2 authorization code flow (with redirect to bank for SCA). **Mutual TLS** with eIDAS QWAC certs is common for authentication of TPPs, plus XML/JSON signing with QSeal cert for non-repudiation. FAPI guidelines were adopted in several API frameworks (many banks now conform to FAPI 1.0). However, some variances: not all banks implemented OIDC fully (some have no ID token). Client auth is anchored in regulatory certificates: TPPs authenticate with their eIDAS cert – effectively a decentralized trust via recognized CAs. **SCA** is mandated: two-factor auth for the user at login, and at least every 90 days for AIS refresh[nvlpubs.nist.gov](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2022/NIST.IR.8389-draft.pdf#:~:text=488%20open%20finance%20ecosystem%20would,30). Supports decoupled auth (some banks use CIBA-like flows for app approval). Overall security is rigorous by law, though initial implementation quality varied. Now largely aligned with FAPI features (PAR, PKCE, etc.) as best practice. | **OAuth 2.0 + OIDC (FAPI)**. The CDR standards align with FAPI 1.0 Advanced Profile as well. Uses OAuth authorization code flow with PKCE. **Mutual TLS** is required for all calls (with both client and server certs). Client auth either via mTLS or `private_key_jwt` with keys from the accreditation register. A government-run **CDR Register** issues **software statements** and public keys for each accredited data recipient, acting as the trust anchor (only accredited parties can invoke APIs)[content.frollo.com.au](https://content.frollo.com.au/Marketing_Content/The+State+of+Open+Banking+2024.pdf#:~:text=,data%20with%20accredited%20third%20parties). Dynamic client registration is facilitated via the register’s assertions. Strong user authentication (generally via bank’s existing MFA) is required. Consent and auth requests often use **PAR (Pushed Auth Requests)** to ensure secure, signed parameters[openid.net](https://openid.net/wordpress-content/uploads/2023/01/OIDF-Whitepaper_Open-Banking-and-Open-Data-Ready-to-Cross-Borders_Final.pdf#:~:text=delivery%20Signed%20request%20object%20via,channel%20Signed%20request%20object%20via). The **ID token** and consent details are often returned to data recipients. All tokens have finite short lifespans (refresh tokens max 3 months) to enforce re-auth. Security is very tight – arguably combining the strictest elements of UK/EU (government accreditation + technical FAPI profile). |
| **Consent & User Control** | **User-permissioned access** is a core principle[mx.com](https://www.mx.com/blog/why-fdx-matters/#:~:text=FDX%20is%20centered%20around%20five,sharing%20principles%20that%20empower%20users). FDX APIs use scope-based consent via OAuth – the third-party requests specific data scopes (standardized by FDX, e.g., accounts, transactions, investments). The user authenticates at their bank and sees a consent screen (content varies by bank, as not regulated, but generally indicating what data will be shared and with whom). No fixed duration by standard – typically persists until user revokes or token expires by policy. FDX provides **UX guidelines** for clarity and requires members to honor user control (including providing mechanisms to revoke consent)[mx.com](https://www.mx.com/blog/why-fdx-matters/#:~:text=includes%20three%20components%3A). Many banks offer portals listing connected apps to manage consents[openbankingexpo.com](https://www.openbankingexpo.com/news/fdx-api-adoption-hits-114m-customer-connections/#:~:text=FDX%20noted%20that%20API%20adoption,may%20offer%20less%20customer%20control%E2%80%9D). Since it’s not legally uniform, implementations differ slightly, but _consumer control, transparency, and easy revocation_ are advocated across FDX membership. | **Explicit, granular consent** required. TPPs must specify requested permissions (via standardized OBIE scopes like `ReadTransactions`, `ReadBalances`, etc.), and banks’ consent screens list these in plain language[openbanking.org.uk](https://www.openbanking.org.uk/news/category/impact-report/#:~:text=,Dedicated%20interfaces). User selects accounts to share and authorizes. **Consent duration**: For AIS, indefinite access up to 90 days, then re-confirmation needed (due to PSD2 rule)[nvlpubs.nist.gov](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2022/NIST.IR.8389-draft.pdf#:~:text=488%20open%20finance%20ecosystem%20would,30). Users can revoke at any time via the bank’s **access dashboard** or via the TPP (TPP must delete tokens if user withdraws consent). OBIE Customer Experience Guidelines ensured a consistent, user-friendly consent process across banks (e.g., no extraneous steps, clear wording)[openbanking.org.uk](https://www.openbanking.org.uk/news/category/impact-report/#:~:text=,Directory%20sandbox). Overall, users have a high level of control: they know exactly what data is shared and can rescind easily. | **Consent mandated by law, implemented in bank UIs**. The user must explicitly consent to each AIS or PIS request. Typically, during OAuth, user chooses which accounts and for how long (AIS consents often default to max 90 days). The granularity in EU is often implicit – e.g., consenting to an AIS access usually means all data on chosen accounts, since PSD2’s scope is narrower. Fine-grained data cluster selection is less common than OBIE, though some banks allow choosing e.g. balance vs transactions. Consent info (which TPP, which accounts, when given) must be logged by banks. **90-day re-auth** is mandatory for AIS[nvlpubs.nist.gov](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2022/NIST.IR.8389-draft.pdf#:~:text=488%20open%20finance%20ecosystem%20would,30), effectively limiting consent length. Users can view/revoke consents via their bank (banks must provide a interface for “Third-party access” management). If revoked or expired, the TPP’s access stops (and they get an error indicating consent invalid). Thus, EU ensures consent but with slightly less standardized UX – it was left to each bank’s design within regulatory bounds. Still, the principles of explicit consent and easy withdrawal are upheld by regulation. | **Very fine-grained, user-driven consent**. CDR requires **granular consent** at a data category level (account details, balances, transactions, etc., each can be toggled) and the user must actively select specific accounts to share[openbankingmap.com](https://www.openbankingmap.com/#:~:text=Information%3A%20The%20Consumer%20Data%20Right,economy%2C%20including%20energy%20and%20telecommunications). Consent is **time-bound**: max 12 months validity (often users choose shorter)[pymnts.com](https://www.pymnts.com/bank-regulation/2024/australian-banking-association-open-banking-rules-need-new-pathway-forward/#:~:text=Bligh%20said%20this%20in%20a,their%20data%20between%20service%20providers). The consent authorization flow is detailed: users are shown the accredited recipient’s name, the data requested, and duration, and must agree. The system encourages **informed consent**, sometimes resulting in multi-screen processes. Every data holder (bank) must provide a **Consumer Dashboard** where users can see all active consents, their scope and expiry, and revoke them at any time[pymnts.com](https://www.pymnts.com/bank-regulation/2024/australian-banking-association-open-banking-rules-need-new-pathway-forward/#:~:text=%CE%94). Many consents are one-time or short-lived; over half of consents were not extended past 2023 (users let them lapse)[pymnts.com](https://www.pymnts.com/bank-regulation/2024/australian-banking-association-open-banking-rules-need-new-pathway-forward/#:~:text=data%20between%20service%20providers). This indicates both strong user control and perhaps some friction (leading to low sustained use). Regardless, CDR ensures consumers are in full command of their data sharing – no “open-ended” access is possible; everything is explicit, logged, and time-limited. |

Adoption rates vary: some countries ~20-30% of online users, others in single digits. By 2023, open banking is established but not uniformly thriving in all markets. Many banks report relatively low call volumes, while in certain regions (Nordics, UK which was part of early stats) usage is higher[nvlpubs.nist.gov](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2022/NIST.IR.8389-draft.pdf#:~:text=462%20banking,API%20Access%20Scheme%20to)[fintechs-fairplay.medium.com](https://fintechs-fairplay.medium.com/open-banking-hits-20-adoption-after-six-years-heres-why-that-s-a-problem-5005f48e75b7#:~:text=International%20Competition%20Claims). The regulatory mandate ensured _baseline availability_, and now the focus is on improving user experience and adding premium services. PSD2’s successor proposals (PSD3/FIDA) aim to address remaining gaps (like consistent API performance, adding more data). In summary, EU’s ecosystem is broad (thousands of banks, hundreds of TPPs) – **unparalleled coverage**, but depth of usage is still developing. The concept of open banking is known in finance circles, but consumer awareness remains low in many EU countries compared to UK. | **Slow uptake so far**: Only ~0.3–0.4% of bank customers in Australia have used CDR data sharing by 2023[pymnts.com](https://www.pymnts.com/bank-regulation/2024/australian-banking-association-open-banking-rules-need-new-pathway-forward/#:~:text=%CE%94).

The strict accreditation and read-only scope (no payments yet) may have dampened rapid fintech innovation. Efforts are underway to boost adoption (e.g., tiered accreditation to allow more participants, government awareness campaigns). The inclusion of energy and telecom data in CDR could spur multi-sector apps that attract users. In terms of maturity: technically robust (APIs working well, standards refined), but _market penetration is nascent_. The banking industry invested heavily (~AU$1.5 billion) in CDR infrastructure[pymnts.com](https://www.pymnts.com/bank-regulation/2024/australian-banking-association-open-banking-rules-need-new-pathway-forward/#:~:text=forward%20is%20needed)[pymnts.com](https://www.pymnts.com/bank-regulation/2024/australian-banking-association-open-banking-rules-need-new-pathway-forward/#:~:text=The%20review%20found%20that%20the,four%20years%20after%20their%20launch), so there is commitment, but unlocking consumer value remains a work in progress.

Data model overlaps with others on core account info but extends further. FDX collaborates with Canadian and other international efforts to harmonize (e.g., DGF in Canada aligning with FDX[openbankingmap.com](https://www.openbankingmap.com/#:~:text=Framework%3AOpen%20Baning%20in%20Canada%20Driver%3AGovernment,Type%3ARegulation%20Banks%3ABanks%20implementing%20OpenBanking%20Timeline)[openbankingmap.com](https://www.openbankingmap.com/#:~:text=Shift%20to%20Open%20Banking%20www,Deadline%201%2C%20for%20largest%20institutions)).

Globally, PSD2’s principles (licensing TPPs, using strong auth) have been copied in Brazil, Hong Kong, etc. European standards like Berlin Group also exported (e.g., used in some Middle East implementations). There’s movement toward _Open Finance_ (the proposed EU **FiDA** framework in 2023) to extend scope in alignment with other jurisdictions[openbankingmap.com](https://www.openbankingmap.com/#:~:text=%2A%202021,published)[openbankingmap.com](https://www.openbankingmap.com/#:~:text=%2A%202023,published). | Australia’s CDR was one of the first to legislate cross-sector data sharing, serving as a model for other countries considering similar (e.g., Canada’s thinking beyond banking). The standards team in Australia engaged with UK and others to not reinvent wheels. CDR uses the same OAuth/FAPI baseline, making it security-interoperable. Data-wise, an aggregation platform can map UK, EU, Aus fairly easily since concepts are similar (with local tweaks). Australia is part of global forums discussing common approaches (e.g., GFIN). However, unique elements (like extensive consent rules, central accreditation) mean international firms must adapt processes to enter Aus. As CDR expands sectors, it pushes the envelope on interoperability between banking and other industries’ data – something others will watch closely. |

**Visualizing the landscape:** Below is a conceptual diagram illustrating how these frameworks compare – FDX being industry-driven but covering many data types, vs. OBIE/PSD2/CDR as regulatory-driven with differing scopes.

## Conclusion

In summary, **FDX 6.1**, **UK OBIE**, **EU PSD2**, and **Australian CDR** each contribute to the global move towards open banking/open finance, but with distinct approaches:

-   FDX offers a _unifying technical standard_ emerging from industry cooperation, achieving significant scale in North America with a wide data ambit (open finance). It’s flexible and fast-evolving, though without the force of law (so far).
    
-   OBIE (UK) provided a _prescriptive, regulator-backed standard_ that jump-started a thriving fintech ecosystem in the UK. It demonstrated the value of a single mandated spec and continues to evolve towards open finance.
    
-   PSD2 (EU) established the _legal right_ to data access across a huge market, making Europe a pioneer. Its fragmentation taught lessons about the need for standardization, which Europe is now addressing in the next phase (PSD3/FIDA). It created a template that many other countries have adapted.
    
-   Australia’s CDR took open banking further into a vision of _economy-wide data portability_. It implemented strong consumer protections and broad scope, though the challenge remains to convert infrastructure into high consumer uptake.
    

Despite differences, the overlaps are growing: all use RESTful APIs, OAuth2 security, user consent flows, and strive for interoperability. Ongoing collaboration and standard-setting (through groups like ISO, OpenID, and bilaterals between these regimes) are gradually knitting these initiatives together. The result may be a future where fintech developers and consumers benefit from a more consistent global open banking experience, fulfilling the promise of easier, safer access to financial data wherever you are.
