* * *

What Knowledge You Should Have by End of Week
---------------------------------------------

Here’s the “target picture” you want to be able to walk into an interview with. Use this as checklist / mental model.

* * *

### 1\. Business: Direct Custody & Clearing (DCC)

*   **What exactly DCC offers**: safekeeping of securities, clearing & settlement, cash services, income / corporate actions, foreign exchange (if needed), reporting, regulatory liaison.
*   **Who the clients are**: global custodians, broker-dealers, fund managers, asset owners, private banks etc.
*   **How value is made**: STP (straight-through processing) efficiency, real-time or fast settlement, low error/exception rates, clarity & transparency, strong regulatory compliance, cost control, quality of service.
*   **Market structure dependencies**: local market rules, settlement cycles, market infrastructures, how CSDs / exchanges operate, roles of sub-custodians.

* * *

### 2\. End-to-End System Architecture: Current / Typical

You’ll want to be able to draw a diagram showing all major components, how they link, what flows through. Something like:

1.  **Front-end / client interface layer**: client onboarding, client portal, reporting dashboards, query tools.
2.  **Instruction ingestion / trade capture**: interfaces from clients, brokers, internal trading systems; format normalization; validations & compliance checks.
3.  **Matching / pre-matching / trade repair**: to ensure instructions are correct, match with counterparties or exchanges.
4.  **Clearing / netting**: if applicable; risk / margin management; liquidity management.
5.  **Settlement engine**: interfaces with market infrastructure / CSDs / exchanges; delivery vs payment; cash leg, securities leg.
6.  **Custody / safekeeping**: secure storage of securities (or ledger entries), asset servicing (corporate actions, income, proxy voting etc.), asset register / ownership records.
7.  **Cash management / FX**: managing cash flows, foreign exchange where required.
8.  **Corporate actions / income**: tracking events; distributing payments; handling elections etc.
9.  **Accounting / portfolio accounting / reconciliation**: valuation, fee calculation, amortization, accruals, reporting.
10.  **Regulatory & compliance modules**: risk, audit trails, client documentation, reporting to regulators, KYC/AML where relevant.
11.  **Data / reporting / analytical services**: dashboards, BI, client reporting, risk reporting, management metrics.
12.  **Infrastructure / non-functional components**: identity & access, security, logging, failover, performance, scaling, disaster recovery.

* * *

### 3\. Typical Tech Stack / Components (publicly seen + plausible inside big banks)

*   Many custody platforms are older (“legacy”) systems: batch processing, monoliths, often in mainframes, or large mid-tier apps (e.g. Java / C++ / .NET), relational databases (Oracle, SQL Server, etc.).
*   Increasing trend to move to **componentized / microservices architecture**: smaller services for e.g. corporate actions, settlement engine, matching, reporting. Northern Trust’s “evolve away from large monolithic applications … to a microservices architecture of cloud-enabled components” is an example. [Northern Trust+1](https://www.northerntrust.com/content/dam/northerntrust/asset-servicing/global/en/documents/insights-research/2024/evolution-of-the-custody-business.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
*   Use of vendor platforms: e.g. TCS BaNCS Global Securities Processing Platform. It supports custody, settlement, corporate actions, APIs, etc. Deployed across many markets. [TCS](https://www.tcs.com/who-we-are/newsroom/press-release/tcs-bancs-transforms-standard-bank-custody-settlement-operations-enhanced-customer-experience?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
*   Middleware / messaging / integration layers: queues, message brokers, possibly event-driven architecture.
*   Real-time vs batch: some settlement still batch or end-of-day; increasing demand for shorter cycles (T+1 etc.), so more synchronous or near-real-time components.
*   Data infrastructure: Data warehouses, data lakes, for historical & reporting; real-time data pipelines for monitoring / client reporting.
*   UI/UX / dashboards: Web front ends, client portals, possibly mobile, though most custody business is enterprise / institutional.
*   Security / audit / compliance tools.
*   Connectivity: FIX / SWIFT / ISO 20022 messages with external parties; APIs for clients; connections to market infrastructure (CSDs / exchanges); sub-custodians.
*   Infrastructure: On-premise, private cloud, public cloud or hybrid; Kubernetes / containers; orchestration; continual integration & deployment pipelines; monitoring & observability tools.

* * *

### 4\. Pain Points & Constraints

These are what your interviewers will expect you to know, and they will ask what you’d do about them.

*   Legacy monolithic systems that are fragile, hard to change, slow on onboarding new markets / regulation.
*   Data silos, inconsistent data, lack of normalized data; reporting and analytics often delayed, poor visibility.
*   Poor STP / high manual exception handling, especially for local/cross-border differences.
*   Regulatory changes: shorter settlement cycles, more stringent reporting, KYC/AML, audit, transparency.
*   Market infrastructure variability across jurisdictions: different CSDs, different cut-offs, different rules, different levels of digital readiness.
*   Scalability (volume growth, peaks), resilience, high availability / disaster recovery.
*   Cybersecurity risks; protecting client assets, custody integrity; segregation of assets; audit trails.
*   Cost pressures: need to reduce ops cost while maintaining (or improving) service levels; competitive differentiation.
*   Client expectations: real-time or near real-time reporting; APIs; transparency; digital experience.
*   Complexity of integrating new asset types: tokenised assets / digital assets; blockchain; crypto; ESG etc.

* * *

### 5\. Future State / Requirements for “Modern DCC Platform”

What a modern, future-proof architecture and platform should have. You’ll want to propose something along these lines.

*   **Modular, componentized architecture / microservices** to allow adding new markets, asset classes, services without full rewrites.
*   **Cloud-ready / hybrid cloud** infrastructure for scalability, flexibility, resilience.
*   **API-first design** for external connectivity (clients, market infrastructures, sub-custodians), internal modularity.
*   **Event-driven architecture** where relevant, to support real-time or near-real-time flows, notifications, corporate actions, settlement statuses etc.
*   **Data as a service / real-time observability & reporting** so clients can access data (latency / variety / consistency) in near real time.
*   **High STP rates (“straight-through processing”)**; exception management framework.
*   **Robust compliance / governance / audit / security framework** built in: secure identity, role/segregation, encryption, traceability, disaster recovery.
*   **Support for multiple markets jurisdictions**: localization, differing market rules, varied CSD infrastructures.
*   **Support for traditional and newer asset types** (tokenization, digital assets) if HSBC’s strategy includes that.
*   **Good UX / client interfaces**, self-service portals, dashboards etc.
*   **Operational resilience**: monitoring, observability, error-handling, resilience to failures, scalability, performance.
*   **Tech debt management / legacy system migration path** – you need a strategy for modernizing while preserving service continuity.

* * *

## Prompt:
my strong background on open banking. how can mapping my skillset with the future state architect of DCSC

## Response:
Great question — mapping your **open banking skillset** to the **future-state Direct Custody & Clearing (DCC)** architecture is a powerful way to differentiate yourself. Here’s a structured mapping you can use in interviews and in your 100-day roadmap discussions.

* * *

🔗 Mapping Open Banking Experience → Future State DCC Architecture
==================================================================

### 1\. **API-First Design**

*   **Open Banking Experience**: You’ve worked with PSD2 / Open Banking APIs, secure API gateways, consent management, and developer portals.
*   **DCC Future State Need**: Custody clients (asset managers, global custodians, brokers) increasingly demand API access for:
    *   Trade status queries
    *   Settlement confirmations
    *   Corporate action updates
    *   Cash balances / FX rates
*   **Mapping**: Position yourself as the person who can **translate client-facing custody services into secure, standardized APIs** — just like account/transaction APIs in open banking.

* * *

### 2\. **Security & Consent**

*   **Open Banking Experience**: Implementing OAuth2.0 / OpenID Connect, fine-grained access, customer consent & revocation, audit trails.
*   **DCC Future State Need**: Strong identity & access management for institutional clients, regulators require full auditability.
*   **Mapping**: You can introduce **API-level security and consent management frameworks** to replace brittle legacy user ID/password models in custody portals.

* * *

### 3\. **Ecosystem Integration**

*   **Open Banking Experience**: Integrating banks with fintechs, TPPs, and external ecosystems.
*   **DCC Future State Need**: Integrating HSBC custody platform with:
    *   Market infrastructures (CSDs, exchanges, CCPs) via ISO 20022 APIs.
    *   Clients’ internal systems via APIs (no more SWIFT-only).
    *   Future: tokenization / blockchain custodians.
*   **Mapping**: You know how to design for **ecosystem interoperability**, vendor neutrality, and future-proofing — critical for custody modernization.

* * *

### 4\. **Event-Driven Architecture**
