* * *

Would you like me to also create a **PDF study tracker/checklist** (with 60 days marked, tick boxes, and links) so you can use it as a daily guide?

## Prompt:
yes please

## Response:
Here’s your **60-day Microservices & API Study Tracker** in PDF format — with daily topics, URLs, and checkboxes for progress tracking:

📂 Download Microservices\_API\_Study\_Tracker.pdf

Would you like me to also prepare a **condensed 2-page cheat sheet** (key diagrams, must-know concepts, and interview-ready bullet points) to complement this daily tracker?

## Prompt:
yes

## Response:
Here’s your **2-page Microservices & API Cheat Sheet** — covering principles, API best practices, service mesh, Kubernetes, security, advanced topics, and interview tips:

📂 Download Microservices\_API\_Cheat\_Sheet.pdf

Would you like me to also create a **mock interview Q&A pack** (with 20+ technical and behavioral questions, plus model answers) so you can practice before your HSBC interview?

## Prompt:
yes

## Response:
Here’s your **Mock Interview Q&A Pack** — with 20+ curated technical and behavioral questions (and model answers) tailored for **Microservices, APIs, Service Mesh, Security, and HSBC context**:

📂 Download Microservices\_API\_Mock\_Interview\_QA.pdf

Do you want me to also prepare a **whiteboard system design exercise pack** (with diagrams + prompts for practice, e.g., “Design a secure Open Banking API Gateway”) so you can simulate real interview scenarios?

## Prompt:
yes

## Response:
Thought for a couple of seconds

I need to make

Done

Done! Your **System Design Whiteboard Practice Pack** is ready — 5 interview-style exercises with starter diagrams, constraints, “what to cover” checklists, plus blank grid pages and a final checklist:

📂 Download System\_Design\_Whiteboard\_Pack.pdf

If you want, I can tailor one exercise to your **actual HSBC team/domain** once you share the JD or platform details.

## Prompt:
what's that

## Response:
That file is a **practice pack I generated for you**:

**📐 System\_Design\_Whiteboard\_Pack.pdf**

It contains:

*   **5 full interview-style design exercises** (like what HSBC may ask you):
    1.  Secure Open Banking API Gateway
    2.  Payments Microservice with Idempotency
    3.  Service Mesh Observability & Traffic Control
    4.  Global Rate Limiting & Throttling
    5.  Event-Driven Fraud/Risk Scoring
*   Each exercise includes:
    *   A **prompt** (what you’re asked to design)
    *   **Constraints** (e.g., regulations, security, performance targets)
    *   A **starter diagram** (so you can sketch further)
    *   A checklist of “what to cover”
*   **Extra blank whiteboard grids** so you can sketch and simulate a real whiteboard interview.
*   A **system design checklist appendix** (latency, SLOs, resilience, security, observability, etc.)

👉 Basically, it’s a **hands-on interview prep workbook** — you can print it or use it on-screen to practice whiteboard/system design problems.

Would you like me to also give you a **step-by-step guide on how to actually use this pack for practice** (like a 1-hour mock interview simulation flow)?

## Prompt:
yes

## Response:
Perfect 👌 Here’s how to **use the System Design Whiteboard Pack in a 1-hour simulation**, to make the most of it and mirror the style of senior-level interviews (like HSBC GCB3):

* * *

⏱️ 1-Hour Mock Interview Simulation Guide
=========================================

Step 1 – Setup (5 minutes)
--------------------------

*   Pick **one exercise** from the pack (e.g., “Secure Open Banking API Gateway”).
*   Get a **timer**, a **pen + notebook** (or tablet/whiteboard), and the PDF open.
*   Imagine the interviewer has just asked you:
    > _“Please design this system at a high level. Walk me through your thought process.”_

* * *

Step 2 – Clarify Requirements (5 minutes)
-----------------------------------------

*   Spend 3–5 minutes asking yourself “interviewer-style” questions:
    *   What’s the **scope** of the problem? (Users? APIs? SLAs?)
    *   What are the **non-functional requirements**? (Latency, availability, compliance)
    *   Are there **constraints** (e.g., regulatory like PCI-DSS, GDPR)?

💡 Tip: Always **clarify assumptions out loud** — shows seniority.

* * *

Step 3 – High-Level Design (15 minutes)
---------------------------------------

*   Draw your **core architecture** (API Gateway, services, databases, external systems).
*   Identify **data flow** (requests, events, async flows).
*   Map to **patterns** (e.g., Saga, CQRS, Strangler Fig).
*   Highlight **trade-offs** (simplicity vs flexibility, REST vs GraphQL, SQL vs NoSQL).

* * *

Step 4 – Deep Dive (20 minutes)
-------------------------------

Pick 2–3 focus areas (interviewers will usually guide you here):

*   **Security**: OAuth2, mTLS, JWT, secrets, rate limiting.
*   **Resilience**: retries, circuit breakers, failover.
*   **Data Consistency**: Saga vs 2PC, idempotency keys, replay safety.
*   **Observability**: logs, metrics, tracing, golden signals.
*   **Scalability**: sharding, load balancing, caching.

💡 Use the **“What to cover” checklist** in each exercise page to stay sharp.

* * *

Step 5 – Wrap-Up (10 minutes)
-----------------------------

*   Summarize your design in 2–3 crisp points:
    1.  _How it meets functional needs_
    2.  _How it meets non-functional needs (security, scale, resilience)_
    3.  _What risks remain + trade-offs made_
*   Optional: Suggest **future improvements** (multi-region DR, chaos testing, cost optimization).

* * *

Step 6 – Self-Review (5 minutes)
--------------------------------

*   Use the **appendix checklist** in the pack to see if you hit all areas:
    *   Security ✅
    *   Observability ✅
    *   Scalability ✅
    *   Resilience ✅
    *   Compliance ✅
*   Record your session (if possible) and watch:
    *   Did you **communicate clearly**?
    *   Did you **think aloud**?
    *   Did you **balance depth vs breadth**?

* * *

🔁 Practice Routine
===================

*   Do **2–3 sessions per week** with different exercises.
*   Rotate **focus areas** (security one day, scalability next, observability another).
*   By week 8, you should be able to **whiteboard a design in 30 minutes** confidently.

* * *

👉 Would you like me to **add a timed “dry-run script”** (like a roleplay guide where I act as the interviewer and give you prompts & follow-ups)? That way you can simulate a **real conversation-style interview**.
